crafting a croft
lara croft was created by studio core design in derby uk in 1996 the studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3d adventure game for playstation 1 a game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene 

as the game was about ‘raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids’ the lead character would need to look adventurous and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions after some deliberation lara croft was born a young upperclass and utterly british woman who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and selfreliant

success and controversy
tomb raider 1996 was a breakaway success for core design who quickly doubled down on building tomb raider 2 1997 and 3 1998 a big part of the success was attributed to the games’ leading lady who found admirers both with male and female players this baffled critics who just saw lara croft as a sexist cartoon

a donald duck story
every single day writers in the netherlands and across the world are busy thinking up new duck stories these stories are then converted into scenarios when designing a scenario the writer makes important decisions how many images should appear on a page what happens in each image should donald feature close up or from far away throughout this process the writer needs to put himself or herself in donald duck’s shoes remembering that he has flat feet in practice that isn’t easy

the creative process behind a donald duck illustration
once the writer has thought up the whole story an artist converts the scenario into a series of beautiful illustrations and then one last but important thing is missing colour when creating a donald duck story a lot of careful thought is put into colour donalds beak is orange but did you know that there are over 100 shades of orange alone the colourist always tries to identify the best colour combinations so that the comic comes into its own
