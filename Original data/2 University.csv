50,University Museum,2019,Spaceship Earth,"The exhibition Spaceship Earth, compiled by guest curator Eva Rovers, challenges visitors to take a look at the world through the eyes of an astronaut. It is a journey from the macrocosm to the microcosm that makes you realize that everything is connected. At every ‘stop’, a historical object from the University collection tells a contemporary story about the richness and vulnerability of the earth.

The design of the exhibition is in the hands of five young artists from Groningen who have turned these ‘stops’ into spectacular Cabinets of Curiosities. This design was inspired by a curiosity cabinet by Boudewijn Büch, which by way of rare exception has been made available for exhibition (courtesy of the Teylers Museum). This exhibition was supported by the University Library, the Vereniging Vrienden Academisch Erfgoed Groningen [Friends of the Groningen Academic Heritage Association] and the Nicolaas Mulerius Foundation.

Book presentation: De rebelse held
The exhibition will be accompanied by Eva Rovers’ book De rebelse held [‘The rebel hero’], a volume of provocative letters to the creator of the concept of Spaceship Earth: the eccentric, almost forgotten inventor, architect, car designer, philosopher and futurist Richard Buckminster Fuller – also known as ‘the Leonardo Da Vinci of the twentieth century’. Over half a century ago, he developed numerous eccentric solutions to today’s problems, varying from climate change and failing democracies to the dark sides of the tech revolution. He invented flying cars, self-sufficient houses and a bizarre map of the world in order to keep ‘Spaceship Earth’ liveable, now and in the future.",2019.6-2019.11
51,University Museum,2019,Dead Zoo,"This exhibition centres around the University Museum’s impressive zoology collection that has been compiled by numerous scientists. In a virtual journey through Africa, America, Oceania, Eurasia and the underwater world, visitors get to meet colourful birds, rare spiders, beautiful fish, scary predators and much, much more.",##
52,University Museum,2019,Spitsbergen 79,"In 1979 the first externally financed expedition of the University of Groningen, led by Louwrens Hacquebord, left for Amsterdam Island near Spitsbergen. As part of the Arctic Centre Groningen they conducted research into the stay of seventeenth century whalers and the influence of the Dutch Whaling industry on the arctic surroundings.

Forty years later we look back on this remarkable project with never before published photographs by expedition member and scientific photographer Ben Bekooy.
Many different views and alternative facts on climate change in the media. But what are the real facts? What does science tell us? And how urgent will climate change be? Following our exhibition on Spitsbergen 79 with a special climate room (only to be seen until 1 March), we are organizing a lunch lecture about this very topical subject.
It is now clear that climate has become warmer in the past decades. And it is also ""highly likely"" (IPCC) that this warming is caused primarily by the increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, which enhances the natural greenhouse effect. And that increase, in its turn, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas).

But: how does the greenhouse effect actually work? And how much is caused by human activities? And what do we observe? And, finally: what will be the future? In this interesting lunch lecture Harro Meijer, expert on isotope research, examines the science behind climate change. He will clarify this topic for you to get to know all the real facts!",2019.12-2020.3
53,University Museum,2020,DIG IT ALL. Archaeology of the future,"DIG IT ALL reveals the groundbreaking technology of modern archeology. In honour of the centennial of the Groningen Institute of Archaeology we offer a glimpse behind the scenes of this fascinating research area. Archaeologists have a clever way of using digital technologies, such as virtual reality, 3D reconstructions and drone images. This approach offers innovative opportunities of digging into the past.

The exhibition lets you experience what it is like being at an archaeological dig: through VR you can immerse yourself in tombs in ancient Italy and Greece; 3D-reconstructions bring the discovered objects, such as pottery items, to life; shipwrecks in the Dutch polders are discovered by digital analysis of small differences in height in the landscape. The archaeology of plants and animals in the Netherlands are mapped by digital reference collections. Closer to home, we take a look at the liberation of the city of Groningen after World War II and show the war-time finds in our own city on an interactive map.

A part of the exhibition can also be experienced from home: watch 3D-reconstructions of archaeological objects, discover internactive digital maps and read stories behind the groundbreaking techniques within the field of archaeology.",##
54,University Museum,2021,Masterminds. The History of the University of Groningen,"Masterminds takes you through the history of science, featuring ground-breaking research and major scientific discoveries at the University of Groningen.

55,University Museum,2021,Did you read that! 50 years of Universiteitskrant,"The first edition of Universiteitskrant (UK) Groningen dates from 1 September 1971. The Universiteitskrant was the first modern and independant weekly university newspaper in The Netherlands, published by an independant organization.

The newspaper brought news and was, especially in its early years, a platform for often hefty debates. A half a century later the UK, or Ukrant as it is now called, is still an independant news platform for the academic community in Groningen.

50 years of Universiteitskrant is celebrated with a special book and two exhibitions: one at the Univeristy Museum and one at the University Library.

The small exhibition at the University Museum shows the development the Universiteitskrant went through in the last 50 years: from a black-and-white newspaper with hardly any pictures in 1971 to a colourful and biligual internet platform.

Eventhough its appearance changed, one thing remained the same in those fifty years: its independance, which had to be fought for now and then, and which is shown through a couple of talked-about events.",##
56,University Museum,2022,Under the spell of growth,"After more than ten years of research, university historian Klaas van Berkel has finished his project on the history of the University of Groningen. The University Museum has composed a small exhibition to accompany the publication of the third part of Universiteit van het Noorden in which Klaas van Berkel describes the period after 1945 which is - amongst other things - characterized by growth.

After the war, the Groningen university grew faster than its Dutch sister universities. While Groningen used to be the smallest university, it is now the second largest. This growth started after 1955, thanks to population growth, an increase in prosperity and an expansion of subsidies for studying (through grants and higher taxes). In the exhibition three things are highlighted that were accelerated by the university's growth: democratization, expansion and changes in education and research.",##
57,University Museum,2022,Animal Tales,"The objects in this exhibition, collected by professor Theo van Baaren (1912 - 1989), tell stories in which animals play a central role. The origins of Van Baaren’s large collection are inextricably linked to the colonial past of The Netherlands.

The exhibition Animal Tales, organised as part of the cultural manifestation Bittersweet Heritage (18 February -12 September 2022), researches the origin of various objects and their stories, and reflect on the possibility that they may eventually return to their home.
To what extent was Groningen involved in slavery? What traces of the history of slavery do you see? Which of its effects are still visible in our society?
These questions are the main topics of the activities and education programs that 'Bitterzoet Erfgoed' (Bittersweet Heritage) initiates and supports. On July 1 2023, we will celebrate the abolition of slavery during Keti Koti. Keep an eye on this website for the comprehensive cultural program of Keti Koti Celebration Groningen.",2022.7-2023.1
58,University Museum,2022,Petrus Camper Revisited,"Based on his own research and religious beliefs, scientist Petrus Camper (1722-1789) was a fierce opponent of slavery and white supremacy. However, fellow scientists used Camper's work to justify supremacy and slavery.

In the exhibition Petrus Camper Revisited, organised as part of the cultural manifestation Bittersweet Heritage (18 February -12 September 2022), we examine Petrus Camper’s research from a 21st-century perspective. How do we approach his legacy today?

60,University Museum,2023,Display-window Oude Kijk in 't Jatstraat,"Poster exhibition 75 years of Studium Generale Groningen
Studium Generale Groningen (SGG) is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year! In honor of this momentous occasion, SGG and the University Museum explored their basement archives to dig up over 1300 posters to add them to the museum’s collection - because to waste not is to want not.

A digitalisation of the collection is currently in the works. With the exhibition in the windows of the University Museum (Oude Kijk in 't Jatstraat, between University Museum and I-shop), we are offering a small preview.",##
61,University Museum,2023,Anatomical Theatre,"In the museum's anatomical theatre around 50 anatomical preparations are on display, as well as some skeletons and wax preparations. Some of the anatomical preparations are from the eighteenth century collections of Pieter de Riemer and professor Petrus Camper. Parts of the human body were prepared for educational purposes, such as a heart, a kidney or a section of bone to show the bone structure.
Anatomical Theatre
In 1615 the first anatomical lesson took place in Groningen in simple surroundings. In later years an anatomical theatre with a round gallery was built in the sacristy of the old Church of Friars Minor. An anatomical theatre was a crown jewel for a university in the seventeenth century. The museum's anatomy room is arranged like an anatomical theatre.

In an anatomical theatre, the body was put on a central dissecting table, while professors, students and commoners watched. It wasn’t  just human bodies that were examined. In 1620 Nicolaas Mulerius publicly dissected a horse and a monkey.

Anatomical preparations
Acquiring bodies was difficult in those days. Doctors depended on condemned criminals and strangers. Sometimes bodies were brought in from the hospice in Amsterdam, but that was only possible in winter, when conditions for preservation were good.

Because of this, a lot of time and energy was devoted to preserve body parts in alcohol. Anatomists like Pieter de Riemer and Petrus Camper acquired extensive collections of foetuses, dissected hearts and other organs preserved in alcohol. Abnormal specimens were meticulously collected too, such as Siamese twins or children suffering from hydrocephaly.

Special objects
This anatomical theatre presents some of the collection of the anatomists and doctors in Groningen. The ‘dissected man’ is especially interesting. He was a young, 27-year-old man, dissected into seven pieces around 1920. Anatomist Jan-Willem Wijhe wrote about his specimen: ‘To be able to saw through the torso like this, it is necessary to first freeze him in a mixture of ice and kitchen salt, until he’s hard like a rock; he then sounds like a bell when stricken with a hammer’

Another interesting sample is the skeleton in the middle: the man with the stooped back. He suffered from Pott’s disease, a form of tuberculosis that not only affects the lungs, but also the intervertebral discs. This results in the familiar hump.
The final piece of interest is De Riemer’s human intestine specimen. The lymphatic vessels have been made visible by injecting them with mercury.",##
62,University Museum,2023,Consultation room of dr. Aletta Jacobs,"With the official opening of the refurbished Aletta Jacobs room in 2018 by Lilianne Ploumen, the University Museum Groningen is presenting three iconic objects from Dutch history. These were specially selected for the ‘Canon of Dutch History’ and give a unique insight into the history of women’s emancipation.

In presenting these pieces, the University Museum Groningen officially enters the national Canon Network. Willem Bijleveld, director of the Netherlands Open Air Museum, presented Prof. Elmer Sterken, the then President of the University of Groningen, with the Canon Shield that symbolizes membership of the network.
Aletta Jacobs can rightly be called a power woman. Not only was she the first female in the Netherlands to graduate from university, she also defended prostitutes, introduced the cervical cap in the Netherlands, fought for women’s voting rights  and travelled all over the world to promote world peace.

This consulting room contains many of her personal belongings. In the corner you can see the suitcase she took with her on the journeys  all the way to China and South Africa. Her watch is also on display, as are her tea cosy and rusk tin.

Ever since childhood, she knew she wanted to be a doctor. ‘From my sixth birthday on, I insisted with the utmost certainty that I was going to be a doctor. Not for a second the thought entered my mind, that this might be hard for a girl. At home boys and girls were alike in every way,’ she wrote later.

Her path proved to be a difficult one. To enrol at the university, she had to take the entrance exam. But without a proper preparatory education, she was never going to pass.

So Aletta studied to become an apprentice pharmacist. She passed the exam when she was sixteen. Then she heard that a boy who had the same diploma she did, had been given dispensation by special permission by minister Thorbecke. Aletta didn’t hesitate, but wrote to Thorbecke to ask for the same clemency. On the 28th of April 1871, when Aletta was seventeen years old, she was allowed to enrol at the University of Groningen on trial. One year later, on his deathbed, Thorbecke arranged for her definite admission.

Aletta still had a tough road ahead. She and her family were ridiculed and made fun of. One of her brothers even said she was dead to him, because of the harassment. In 1878 however, she passed her medical exam. Her doctor’s degree followed a year later.

It was the start of a life marked by the battle for women’s rights. She won her greatest victory when women got the right to vote in 1919.

Highlights of the Canon of Dutch History
The Canon comprises 50 ‘windows’ through which you see people, events and objects that together tell the history of the Netherlands. Aletta Jacobs is one of these windows. Three iconic objects from Dutch history are presented in the Aletta Jacobs room in the University Museum, because they give a unique insight into the history of women’s emancipation. They bring you closer to the life of Aletta Jacobs and the zeitgeist of her time.

The objects comprise a trunk belonging to Aletta Jacobs, a womb model by the Auzoux firm and Aletta Jacobs’ desk.

The trunk tells the story of Aletta Jacobs’ major world trips in 1911 and 1912. She travelled around the world with the American Carrie Chapman Catt, the first chair of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, to give shape to the global fight for female emancipation. The trunk accompanied her on these trips. It contains the hats, gowns and jewellery that she wore when speaking to groups or meeting important people. Her initials are still just about visible.

The womb model by the Auzoux firm embodies the modernization of medicine in the 19th century, when observational learning was introduced. The model from 1844 was still in use when Aletta Jacobs began studying medicine in Groningen. During her studies she discovered how doctors treated women, how little women knew about their bodies and above all how little control they had over their own bodies. The womb model thus symbolizes knowledge of and control over the female body.

Aletta Jacobs must have used her desk for her extensive writing. She had a huge network. In her work as a GP she sat at her desk to write letters and prescriptions for her patients. She probably also sat at her desk during many consultations with female patients. She may have sat here in 1898 to write her book De vrouw. Haar bouw en haar inwendige organen, which aimed to teach women more about their own bodies.

Aletta Year: 20 April 2021 – 20 April 2022
The UG will use the Aletta Year to highlight the theme of ‘women in academia’. The University community will be honouring Aletta Jacobs with a year-long programme filled with jointly organized activities to draw continuing attention to the role of diversity in academia. Exactly 150 years after Aletta Jacobs was the first woman in the Netherlands to register at a university as a regular student, on 20 April 2021, the UG, UMCG, Aletta Jacobs School of Public Health, University Museum and Studium Generale will jointly kick off the Aletta Year in honour of Aletta Jacobs.",##
63,University Museum,2023,Panorama of science,"The University of Groningen was founded in 1614. Over four centuries of education and research have left their mark: the academic heritage collection of the University Museum Groningen has grown into one of the finest and largest museum collections in the north of the Netherlands and one of the largest scientific collections in the entire country.

The museum holds about one hundred thousand objects. Together, they tell the story of the University of Groningen and show the advancement of all branches of science.
Around a hundred of these objects are highlighted in the new book Panorama of Science . It features the stories of those remarkable, ingenious and rare museum pieces.
Many of these objects are part of the permanent exhibition Masterminds. Additionally, a number of other exceptional objects discussed in the book are on display in this exhibition.",##
64,University Museum,2024,Kaleidoscope. Hidden Treasures from the University Collection,"Kaleidoscope reveals hidden treasures from the wondrous University of Groningen Collection. From an endless selection of beautiful birds found all over the world, to a BMW car used for psychological research. Admire colorful crystals and stones, or view a student room from the 19th century.

Much has been collected since the founding of the University of Groningen in 1614, by professors such as Theodorus van Swinderen and Petrus Camper, among others. In 1934, the University Museum was established to build a historical collection. Later the collection was enriched with those of disbanded museums, laboratories and collections such as the Nature Museum, the Anatomical Museum, the Ethnographic Museum ""Gerardus van der Leeuw"" and collections of psychology and physics. Kaleidoscope takes you on a journey through these areas of science and shows the rich history through more than 200 unique objects.

The exhibition also invites you to decide for yourself which objects you find most beautiful, most special or most spectacular. Vote for your favorite pearls from the University Collection.
