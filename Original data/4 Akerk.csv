78,Akerk,2020,GIMME SHELTER,"The Rolling Stones. The British band has been at the absolute top for almost sixty years. Called the Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World, they sold countless albums, played to millions of people on all continents and influenced countless musicians and thus music history.

In GIMME SHELTER, the early days of the band are discussed in detail, through the eyes of a number of photographers and filmmakers. Because when five men formed a band together in 1962, they had no idea what their adventure would lead to. The music world was not yet used to frenzied fans and police surveillance. It is of course not without reason that the completely out of control performance at the Kurhaus, the first concert of The Stones on the European mainland, is still legendary.

Central to the exhibition is the work of photographers Bent Rej, Rob Bosboom, Gijsbert Hanekroot and Claude Vanheye. The work of Rej and Bosboom (both now deceased) was made at a time when musicians still allowed photographers to get close. This certainly applies to Rej, who traveled with The Stones for a year and thus became a chronicler of their first years on the road. We actually enter the lives of the young musicians. As the Netherlands' first real pop photographers, Hanekroot and Vanheye later managed to create distinctive work within the opportunities that the music industry gave them.

Between the photos you can see striking television fragments from the archives of the Dutch broadcasters, which show how deeply The Stones have anchored themselves in our culture. In the adjacent room you can enjoy a continuous film screening in the Gimme Shelter cinema with longer documentaries, including from their early years and about the memorable concert they gave in Groningen.",2020.11-2021.5
79,Akerk,2022,Bittersweet Heritage,"The cultural event Bitterzoet Heritage draws regional and national attention to the traces of the slavery past in the city and province of Groningen. In the Akerk we present a unique exhibition, with works of art created especially for this event by Aimée Terburg, Faisel Saro, Esli Tapilatu and Hedy Tjin.

For example, the Dutch-Surinamese artist Aimée Terburg has created a spatial installation of canvases on high, vertical constructions in the choir of the church. By walking around the work, the visitor discovers changing colors and patterns from different viewing angles. The triangle and the diamond are central figures in this work. These refer, among other things, to the apoetoe motif. This is a diamond pattern from Maroon woodcarving, which represents harmony and connection.
The Antillean-Surinamese artist Faisel Saro creates an installation artwork in the sacristy, in which drawing and projection come together. In his artwork, Saro focuses on the great importance of the Winti faith for resistance to slavery and the relationship with Christianity.
In his artwork, the Dutch-Moluccan artist Esli Tapilatu gives a visual interpretation of what happened 'spiritually' when the Dutch first came to the Moluccas. In this visual interpretation he interweaves what the Bible says about how to deal with sin and injustice and draws colonial history into the present.

Tapestry Groningen threads from the colonial past
A central role is reserved for a unique, monumental tapestry measuring no less than 2.5 by 35 meters, in which the traces of Groningen's slavery past are depicted. The tapestry was designed by the Dutch-Surinamese illustrator and image maker Hedy Tjin and is produced live during the opening hours of the church together with a group of volunteers with knowledge and skills in the field of textile working methods.

The exhibition is curated by guest curator Ricardo Burgzorg.

80,Akerk,2022,Art Without Borders,"Art Without Borders can be seen in the Akerk from July 15 to August 28. This exhibition features work by artists Farad Gavzan, Hossein Tadi and Amir Mohamadzadeh. The exhibition provides an image of contemporary cultural life in Iran. The exhibition is curated by curator Willem Vugteveen (director of the La Bohème Foundation).

Art Without Borders
In a modest way, visitors are introduced to a group of young people who communicate through their art. It shows that art knows no boundaries and that the cross-pollination of east and west is not stopped by boundaries. By showing art in symbols of Christianity (Akerk) and the domain of Judaism (Synagogue), a dialogue is initiated. This dialogue is not only shown in images, but also conducted in words and music. Although this is not about mixing cultures, it is about bringing diverse cultures under one roof. In this way, an attempt is made to reach visitors with diverse backgrounds, with art serving as a bridge to enter another world that often has a surprising number of similarities with the world we know.

The artists
Farhad Gavzan is a mentor to a large group of young artists. Founder of the Drawing House in 2005 and of the Drawing Museum in 2017. Gavzan shows a number of works of art in this exhibition, including a large installation. The installation was created when he invited visitors to cut up a six-meter-long drawing during the opening of an exhibition. This torn drawing can be seen in the Akerk and consists of two large elongated figures. A video shows visitors tearing up the drawing, the drawing he had worked on for months and was at that moment the most precious possession he could sacrifice for freedom and peace in the world.

Hossein Tadi is a cartoonist in Tehran. He currently works as a senior expert at the Ali Akbar Sanati Museum and the Tehran Peace Museum. Tadi is also a curator for other visual artists and he worked on various performances, workshops, publishing various articles in newspapers and art magazines. Hossein Tadi exhibits a series of large drawings in the Akerk.

Amir Mohamadzadeh is a multi-talent who, in addition to drawing and painting, writes poems and composes music. He has founded a foundation that has been involved for years in providing art and music education to groups of children in deprived neighborhoods in the city of Tehran. Amir will exhibit a series of large drawings in the Akerk and will also create an interactive work of art. A series of small drawings that he made last year during the corona period and which cannot be exhibited in Iran due to their content will also be presented.

Akerk
During Art Without Borders, the unknown art scene of Iran is central and is highlighted from different points of view. In the past, the Akerk stood in the port area of ​​Groningen and was a place where people, especially sailors, were connected to the whole world. By bringing a diverse audience into contact with a largely unknown world, this project fits in perfectly with the history and characteristics of the church and the place where it is located.",2022.7-2022.8
81,Akerk,2024,Janaina Mello Landini,"Janaina Mello Landini in Akerk
Groninger Kerken invited Janaina Mello Landini to create an exhibition in the Akerk of Groningen. As the center piece of the Ciclotrama exhibition, Landini created the impressive installation Floating on site . This work is in dialogue with the environment for which it was created: the high choir of the historic Akerk. In addition, Landini presents existing works from the Ciclotrama series. It is an overview of works of art from 2016 to the present.

Visit the exhibition and immerse yourself in the complex and visually stunning world of Ciclotrama. The series consists of several series, each highlighting a different aspect of a Ciclotrama. Landini's thoughts about and elaborations on rhythm, frequency and time fit well with the Akerk, because the place is full of centuries of history. The path of the Akerk crossed that of many lives, social developments, natural phenomena, etc. In the Ciclotrama all these paths can be seen individually, but you also immediately see the whole. Her work can also encourage reflection on the Akerk itself.

Biography Janaina Mello Landini
Janaina Mello Landini (Brazil, 1974) lives and works in São Paulo. In 1999 she graduated in Architecture, after which she studied Fine Arts, both at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil

Rope is central to her works and are formed into small and large works of art or hanging installations in public spaces. Interaction with the environment plays a major role in her work. Each work takes up space in its own way, makes you look at the space differently and changes when it hangs in a different place.

Landini is fascinated by structures, rhythm, frequency and networks. According to her, these occur in many different places: in nature, mathematics, architecture, but also in society. Sometimes they are clearly visible, sometimes only palpable. She develops this idea in the series of works she calls Ciclotrama.

Janaina Mello Landini has exhibited worldwide, including in Brazil, France, the United States, China and the Middle East. Although she made an installation for the Textile Biennale in Rijswijk (2017), this is the first time that a solo exhibition of her work has been shown in the Netherlands. The series of works of art entitled Ciclotrama is central.

The exhibition Ciclotrama marks her solo debut in the Netherlands and offers visitors the chance to admire her unique works, including the tremendous site-specific installation Floating . Additionally, various works from the Ciclotrama collection will be on display. Janaina Mello Landini, based in São Paulo, is renowned for her creations using rope, ranging from small artworks to impressive installations in public spaces. Her interactive approach to the environment and fascination with structures, rhythms, and networks come to life in the series of works called Ciclotrama.

The historical choir of the Akerk will be the stage for the new artwork Floating , created on-site by Landini. This piece engages in a dialogue with the rich history of the Akerk and is accompanied by an overview of Ciclotrama works from 2016 to the present.",2024.2-2024.6
