in gimme shelter the early days of the band are discussed in detail through the eyes of a number of photographers and filmmakers because when five men formed a band together in 1962 they had no idea what their adventure would lead to the music world was not yet used to frenzied fans and police surveillance it is of course not without reason that the completely out of control performance at the kurhaus the first concert of the stones on the european mainland is still legendary

central to the exhibition is the work of photographers bent rej rob bosboom gijsbert hanekroot and claude vanheye the work of rej and bosboom both now deceased was made at a time when musicians still allowed photographers to get close this certainly applies to rej who traveled with the stones for a year and thus became a chronicler of their first years on the road we actually enter the lives of the young musicians as the netherlands first real pop photographers hanekroot and vanheye later managed to create distinctive work within the opportunities that the music industry gave them

between the photos you can see striking television fragments from the archives of the dutch broadcasters which show how deeply the stones have anchored themselves in our culture in the adjacent room you can enjoy a continuous film screening in the gimme shelter cinema with longer documentaries including from their early years and about the memorable concert they gave in groningen",2020.11-2021.5
