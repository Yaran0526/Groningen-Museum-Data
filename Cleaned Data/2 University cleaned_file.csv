many different views and alternative facts on climate change in the media but what are the real facts what does science tell us and how urgent will climate change be following our exhibition on spitsbergen 79 with a special climate room only to be seen until 1 march we are organizing a lunch lecture about this very topical subject
it is now clear that climate has become warmer in the past decades and it is also highly likely ipcc that this warming is caused primarily by the increase of the atmospheric co2 concentration which enhances the natural greenhouse effect and that increase in its turn is caused by the burning of fossil fuels coal oil and gas

but how does the greenhouse effect actually work and how much is caused by human activities and what do we observe and finally what will be the future in this interesting lunch lecture harro meijer expert on isotope research examines the science behind climate change he will clarify this topic for you to get to know all the real facts",2019.12-2020.3

61.0,University Museum,2023.0,Anatomical Theatre,"in the museums anatomical theatre around 50 anatomical preparations are on display as well as some skeletons and wax preparations some of the anatomical preparations are from the eighteenth century collections of pieter de riemer and professor petrus camper parts of the human body were prepared for educational purposes such as a heart a kidney or a section of bone to show the bone structure
anatomical theatre
in 1615 the first anatomical lesson took place in groningen in simple surroundings in later years an anatomical theatre with a round gallery was built in the sacristy of the old church of friars minor an anatomical theatre was a crown jewel for a university in the seventeenth century the museums anatomy room is arranged like an anatomical theatre

in an anatomical theatre the body was put on a central dissecting table while professors students and commoners watched it wasn’t  just human bodies that were examined in 1620 nicolaas mulerius publicly dissected a horse and a monkey

anatomical preparations
acquiring bodies was difficult in those days doctors depended on condemned criminals and strangers sometimes bodies were brought in from the hospice in amsterdam but that was only possible in winter when conditions for preservation were good

because of this a lot of time and energy was devoted to preserve body parts in alcohol anatomists like pieter de riemer and petrus camper acquired extensive collections of foetuses dissected hearts and other organs preserved in alcohol abnormal specimens were meticulously collected too such as siamese twins or children suffering from hydrocephaly

special objects
this anatomical theatre presents some of the collection of the anatomists and doctors in groningen the ‘dissected man’ is especially interesting he was a young 27yearold man dissected into seven pieces around 1920 anatomist janwillem wijhe wrote about his specimen ‘to be able to saw through the torso like this it is necessary to first freeze him in a mixture of ice and kitchen salt until he’s hard like a rock he then sounds like a bell when stricken with a hammer’

another interesting sample is the skeleton in the middle the man with the stooped back he suffered from pott’s disease a form of tuberculosis that not only affects the lungs but also the intervertebral discs this results in the familiar hump
the final piece of interest is de riemer’s human intestine specimen the lymphatic vessels have been made visible by injecting them with mercury",##
62.0,University Museum,2023.0,Consultation room of dr. Aletta Jacobs,"with the official opening of the refurbished aletta jacobs room in 2018 by lilianne ploumen the university museum groningen is presenting three iconic objects from dutch history these were specially selected for the ‘canon of dutch history’ and give a unique insight into the history of women’s emancipation

in presenting these pieces the university museum groningen officially enters the national canon network willem bijleveld director of the netherlands open air museum presented prof elmer sterken the then president of the university of groningen with the canon shield that symbolizes membership of the network
aletta jacobs can rightly be called a power woman not only was she the first female in the netherlands to graduate from university she also defended prostitutes introduced the cervical cap in the netherlands fought for women’s voting rights  and travelled all over the world to promote world peace

this consulting room contains many of her personal belongings in the corner you can see the suitcase she took with her on the journeys  all the way to china and south africa her watch is also on display as are her tea cosy and rusk tin

ever since childhood she knew she wanted to be a doctor ‘from my sixth birthday on i insisted with the utmost certainty that i was going to be a doctor not for a second the thought entered my mind that this might be hard for a girl at home boys and girls were alike in every way’ she wrote later

her path proved to be a difficult one to enrol at the university she had to take the entrance exam but without a proper preparatory education she was never going to pass

so aletta studied to become an apprentice pharmacist she passed the exam when she was sixteen then she heard that a boy who had the same diploma she did had been given dispensation by special permission by minister thorbecke aletta didn’t hesitate but wrote to thorbecke to ask for the same clemency on the 28th of april 1871 when aletta was seventeen years old she was allowed to enrol at the university of groningen on trial one year later on his deathbed thorbecke arranged for her definite admission

aletta still had a tough road ahead she and her family were ridiculed and made fun of one of her brothers even said she was dead to him because of the harassment in 1878 however she passed her medical exam her doctor’s degree followed a year later

it was the start of a life marked by the battle for women’s rights she won her greatest victory when women got the right to vote in 1919

highlights of the canon of dutch history
the canon comprises 50 ‘windows’ through which you see people events and objects that together tell the history of the netherlands aletta jacobs is one of these windows three iconic objects from dutch history are presented in the aletta jacobs room in the university museum because they give a unique insight into the history of women’s emancipation they bring you closer to the life of aletta jacobs and the zeitgeist of her time

the objects comprise a trunk belonging to aletta jacobs a womb model by the auzoux firm and aletta jacobs’ desk

the trunk tells the story of aletta jacobs’ major world trips in 1911 and 1912 she travelled around the world with the american carrie chapman catt the first chair of the international woman suffrage alliance to give shape to the global fight for female emancipation the trunk accompanied her on these trips it contains the hats gowns and jewellery that she wore when speaking to groups or meeting important people her initials are still just about visible

the womb model by the auzoux firm embodies the modernization of medicine in the 19th century when observational learning was introduced the model from 1844 was still in use when aletta jacobs began studying medicine in groningen during her studies she discovered how doctors treated women how little women knew about their bodies and above all how little control they had over their own bodies the womb model thus symbolizes knowledge of and control over the female body

aletta jacobs must have used her desk for her extensive writing she had a huge network in her work as a gp she sat at her desk to write letters and prescriptions for her patients she probably also sat at her desk during many consultations with female patients she may have sat here in 1898 to write her book de vrouw haar bouw en haar inwendige organen which aimed to teach women more about their own bodies

aletta year 20 april 2021 – 20 april 2022
the ug will use the aletta year to highlight the theme of ‘women in academia’ the university community will be honouring aletta jacobs with a yearlong programme filled with jointly organized activities to draw continuing attention to the role of diversity in academia exactly 150 years after aletta jacobs was the first woman in the netherlands to register at a university as a regular student on 20 april 2021 the ug umcg aletta jacobs school of public health university museum and studium generale will jointly kick off the aletta year in honour of aletta jacobs",##
