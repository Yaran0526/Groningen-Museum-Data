The Dynamics of Dust","in the dynamics of dust philippe dudouit documents the new relationships that the various indigenous historically nomadic inhabitants of the sahelsaharan belt have forged with a territory they cannot pass through freely – or safely – anymore the region a former tourist paradise is now officially offlimits to foreigners due to a burgeoning abduction industry this has made the already dire economic situation even worse cutting off large parts of the population from an income essential to their subsistence

at first glance the rise of islamic terrorism in this area is to blame but a closer look reveals a reality that is much more complex the area now faces a dangerous cocktail of underdevelopment poverty and state failure the new transnational constellation of powers consists of armed islamists human traffickers drugs and weapon smugglers topped off by international interests jockeying to win oil gold and uranium mining rights the lack of political vision for the area’s future in combination with ongoing desertification due to climate change make up for a scenario in which a doomed generation is growing up

dudouit’s work is based on indepth historic geopolitical and cartographic documentation research and analysis as such the dynamics of dust 20082018 constitutes a longterm photographic study on the sociopolitical evolution of the sahelosaharan zone",2019.6-2019.8

50 Years Lauwersmeer | photo walking tour","background
after the flood of 1953 the safety of the dutch coastal areas was reexamined the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management rijkswaterstaat was faced with the choice of raising the dikes around the lauwerszee or closing off the estuary the latter was chosen under pressure from the frisian population the people of groningen were less happy with the closure at the time because this forced the shrimp fleet of zoutkamp to move to the new port of lauwersoog

on may 23 1969 queen juliana supervised how the last caissons were sunk and secured two days later the lauwers sea had officially become a lake after the closure the highlying seabeds which previously belonged to the wadden became dry in the early years large parts of this were virtually left to their own devices so that much nature was created

a long oeuvre precedes this most recent work by the landscape photographer of the north for 30 years broekhuis has cherished the northern landscape’s vastness the freedom of emptiness his work deals with the feeling the land evokes any trueness to nature is subordinate to this the process of interpretation and experimentation – once in the dark room now in front of a screen – is where the work really comes to life

also on show in the exhibition is a crosssection from his earlier photographs and the many books he has published at the start of his career he worked for the magazinenieuwe revu among others and photographed socially engaged subjects later the landscape became central in his work his aesthetic language is already discernible in the early work about the meat industry and continues in his first projects on landscape and architecture with ‘een wijde blik verruimt het denken’a wide view expands thinking commissioned by the gado bus company he establishes his reputation",2019.1-2019.11

90.0,Noorderlicht,2020.0,Noorderlicht International Photo Festival 2020: Generation Z,"generation z the 27th edition of the noorderlicht international photo festival is about the youngest generation of world citizens born after 1995 what is their place in society how do they see their future what are their ambitions by tapping into the hopes and fears of generation z noorderlicht aims to provide insight into their young adult world a sharp selection has been made for the festival that shows a generation focusing on fundamental emancipation processes
generation z is the first group of digital world citizens to have an infinite amount of information at their fingertips from an early age on but they are also naturally aware of its problematic relationship with the truth generation z is witnessing the start of the fourth industrial revolution in which technology is turning labour relations and the very essence of humanity upside down z is confronted with climate threats and an exhausted earth it has no conscious memories of 911 or of a time without war on terror it grows up in a world where it sees itself surrounded by work pressure problems economic stagnation and nationalistic sentiment they are young adults with less expectations of a stable future than their parents something they hold previous generations responsible for

new balance
if one thing is clear to this generation it’s this the current system no longer suffices they collectively take to the streets to bring about change and fight hand in hand for a new balance between the forces that must guarantee the future of this planet z is clearing up radically speeding up things like equality and inclusiveness subjects such as decolonialisation gender equality and body positivity are high on the agenda and that is just the beginning generation z is about realising a turning point creating a basis for a new future and taking responsibility in this story it is the personification of a change in thinking and acting in which all generations will have to participate

since the eighties ton broekhuis 1951 is a passionate photographer who also devoted himself fully to the development of socially engaged photography in the northern netherlands this path led to the founding of the noorderlicht photo festival in 1990 of which he became director in the years that followed noorderlicht developed into a dynamic and idiosyncratic institution earning international respect after his retirement broekhuis picked up his camera anew

in 2018 noorderlicht presented this exhibition in her studio in groningen de volkskrant awarded five stars “the mortality of things sets the theme of his photographs in which he isolates plants that have ceased blossoming driedup seed chambers and dandelion clocks from their surroundings by placing them in front of a black background these little mortals bathe in a soft autumn light crying out in all their insignificance for an attentive eye”",2020.10-2020.12

What if | the future of the northern landscape","since tuesday march 9th we started to welcome visitors again according to the guidelines of the government and rivm if you want to visit the exhibition you must purchase an online free ticket at least four hours prior to your visit we can allow two visitors per half hour wearing a mouth mask is mandatory as is the 15 meter distance rule

at the beginning of this year sign and noorderlicht launched the research project ‘what if’ out of a shared interest in the development of the northern landscape artists linde ex and aebele trijsburg have spent the past few months dealing with the question what will the future northern landscape look like initially they started the research process together along the way linde and aebele veered into two independent directions the results of which are presented together
linde ex assumes a future scenario in which the dikes disappear and people start living with the tides she is particularly interested in shifting the perspective what if we take the measure of benthic life – small creatures living on the seabed – as just as selfevident as the human measure for example linde made scale models of a radial mound – based on historical research – and placed them on the tide line in four locations along the coast of friesland and groningen once there seabed life silt and seawater influence the models whereby the design of the landscape is magnified by the sea the observations of the models influenced by the mud flats form the starting point for the creation of a futuristic scenario and new work for the final presentation

aebele trijsburg focuses on the human factor in the formation of the landscape according to him the fight against water is illustrative for the myths that the netherlands was created by us that we control the water and that without our interventions the country would be halfdrowned aebele believes that this image needs to be reformed the cause of rising sea levels lies primarily with human beings themselves who have turned the land into a kind of bathtub by way of cultivation in order to invest in smart solutions in the long term we need to change our thinking for example by allowing the netherlands’ soil to grow with the water level and by strengthening natural barriers with his work for ‘what if’ aebele hopes to make people aware of the need for this cultural change

linde ex
linde ex nijmegen 1983 is interested in the traces of nonhuman worlds that are often ignored or overlooked she works from a broad research perspective and enjoys collaborating with artists from other disciplines as well as scientists which encourages her to look at things from different angles this way she produced videos installations drawings and books material research is also an important way of approaching a subject in her work linde ex graduated from the frank mohr institute in groningen in 2018 with the master’s degree madtech

aebele trijsburg
in the view of aebele trijsburg barchem 1991 a constant search for meaning is an essential ingredient for understanding ideas such as truth and goodness this process produces work that is both narrative and strange at the same time the narrative character encourages interpretation the surrealistic side blocks the route to clarity aebele trijsburg creates paintings objects sculptures and photographs he graduated from the minerva art academy in groningen in 2013

muddy pink dinosaur
in groningen carlier will investigate how she can preserve the playfulness of the unintentional art she found in the forest within her own work and pass it on to others the project’s title is an ode to the african american folk artist mose tolliver a great source of inspiration to carlier she first became familiar with his work whilst travelling through the united states and was attracted by its sincerity and rough colourful and humorous imagery folk artists such as tolliver have taught carlier to utilise her intuition again which she says had become sidelined over the years through her professionalization as a visual artist this playful unforced manner of making which every person carries within them forms the guiding principle for carlier’s residency at noorderlicht

on monday september 27the netherlands film festival in collaboration with noorderlicht is
organizing an online panel from stadsschouwburg utrecht about the increasing use of ar filters and other digital technologies and their influence on our identity and selfimage curators daniela tenenbaum niv fux will discuss this with three prominent artists who explore the use of ar filters and digital
technologies to challenge our boundaries of being ines alpha andy picci and marcela baltaretethe artists present their work and share their insights in a discussion with the public
“when you look at yourself in the mirror does your image exist is that you or someone else do you exist only as yourself or quite the opposite do you have more than one existence”
these questions posed by jeanluc godard in 1977 seem today more relevant than ever they render some of the longdebated intricacies that lie in the gap between image and representation what is real and what is not and in particular the relationship between the selfimage and the way our image is perceived by others today these issues are becoming further entangled through the ubiquitous presence of the digital image and the growing use of ar filters on social media
as our dependency on digital interactions increases and our physical identity becomes almost overshadowed by the virtual one we recognise great importance in critically looking at the societal
cultural and political implications arising from our reshaping digital selfimage
the wide use of ar filters snapchat lenses and 3d modeling prompt an array of questions on selfrepresentation visual culture and current and future realities  what kind of new opportunities are introduced by these technologies and what are the socalled risks how would the way we perceive ourselves and others be transformed through this and how would these technologies alter the future image",2021.9

Performing Adulthood","what does growing up mean for generation z and how do young people portray themselves performing adulthood is a photography and video project by robin alysha clemens about young people between the ages of 16 and 24 they are in a stage that revolves around forming their own identity and dealing with more responsibilities and independence part of the commission cycle imagining science a collaboration with the state university of groningen in which different research fields serve as inspiration for an autonomous art project robin alysha clemens is the fourth photographer that was given such a commission
performing adulthood is about looking and being seen about hiding and revealing about presenting yourself and how this sometimes fails 

this project provides a glimpse into the world of generation z it prompts us to think about the selfimage of young people for whom the presence of cameras has become a matter of course performing adulthood shows the abrasive inquisitive and sometimes uncomfortable moments that shape our perception of adulthood representation and identity

in performing adulthood robin alysha clemens reverses the roles of photographer and model she invited young people to portray themselves in the studio and then allowed the modelphotographers to select and curate their own photos the project however not only shows the end product of this ‘performance’ but also the process that precedes it the visitor of the exhibition therefore also becomes an observer of the moments that are not posed moments when the performance fails and a photograph ends up in the trash can

in addition to these selfportraits there are six scenes in which different groups of friends talk to each other about subjects such as online dating friendship death climate change loneliness careers housing shortage and social media by observing these interactions an intimate image is created of how these young people present themselves not just to a spectator in a gallery or a photographer with a camera but particularly to each other

in a world where visual representations are more important than ever performing adulthood poses the question what do we show and what would we rather keep hidden how do others see us and how much control do we actually have over it

this project arose from a collaboration with the university of groningen and noorderlicht in the series ‘imagining science’ a photographer is commissioned each year to depict a field of scientific research in relation to a noorderlicht theme this edition’s theme was generation z ",2022.3-2022.5

Out of the Bog","‘out of the bog’ is baukje venema’s photographic collaboration with noorderlicht and the daily newspaper dagblad van het noorden it follows a slow journalism project about poverty in the ‘veenkolonial’ areas where historically peet was dug from the ground about the causes of poverty as often transferred from generation to generation the project features portraits of current residents collages that are based on images from historical archives and texts from the journalistic project
when you are seemingly stuck on paths that have been trodden for generations how do you set out on a new path

the former peat colonies of groningen and drenthe were originally boglands where pioneers cut peat waterways brought wealth and agriculture and industry reinforced each other until the modern age turned its back nowadays the area is associated with deprivation at the same time residents are proud of their region and fed up with its image

how does change come about when your region’s history and image are tied to sod huts and peat labourers when its story and ensuing consequences are woven into the fabric of your family

that is the key question for photographer baukje venema within this exhibition it also provided the starting point for the samenamed journalistic project by maaike borst dagblad van het noorden which tells the stories of the five families shown here from the peat colonies venema drew inspiration from this and created a series of photographs and videos corresponding to the timelines of the written project

old archive images stories and paintings from the region form the basis of this visual investigation into change and transformation over time venema opted for experimental series in which she works with photographs video and paint by abstracting blurring or inverting images the viewer experiences new perspectives

she photographed the current residents using a nineteenthcentury glass plate camera they seem to look back on an eventful past simultaneously they form new benchmarks on an infinite timeline where do you come from where are you where are you going

out of the bog is a collaboration between the noorderlicht photography foundation and dagblad van het noorden

The Financial Zone","the financial zone is a visual investigation into the financial world and its corporate culture nick hannes focusses on situations behind the scenes of a number of financial institutions in the netherlands and belgium he created the photo series as an autonomous commission given by the state university of groningen and noorderlicht
when the media report on economics they usually show images of workers  or operational personnel somewhere in the production chain if white collar employees are depicted at all it’s mostly though stereotypical stock photography men and women in suits smiling wide and shaking hands represent the dynamic character and diversity that the company wants to radiate we rarely see them in real action

photographer nick hannes belgium 1974 went to the head offices of a number of banks and financial companies in the netherlands and belgium to depict office life in a documentary manner with office employees those in charge and the echelon inbetween playing the lead

modular systems and clean desk policy are their environment the new workplace is social and flexible fashionable and homely ergonomic and technological company restaurants offer healthy meals and corporate mindfulness is on the rise there is fitness a prayer room and art on the wall wellbeing in the workplace is important in a time characterised by stress and burnouts

hannes’s photographs are subtle observations of an astonished outsider in a universe not exactly known for visual spectacle he focusses on the relationship between man and his workplace he searches for personal accents in a generic environment meandering along the thin dividing line between banality and surprise between humour and alienation

this photo series was commissioned by the university of groningen and noorderlicht as part of the cycle imagining science hannes has been in dialogue with several researchers at the university the cycle is founded on the idea that science and art have much in common an urge to explore the world around us and to make acquired knowledge tangible to share it these commissions are inspired by university research whose subject is in keeping with the noorderlicht themes in the long term this captures a multifaceted picture of scientific life",2022.4-2022.7

the enlightenment taught us that the earth is a passive ball of resources spinning endlessly across the galaxy following this epiphany came decades of rampant extraction washing of sensitive ecosystems with petrochemicals altering the soil waters and atmosphere there’s now enough evidence to suggest that the earth is not just a static background indifferent to human actions but rather that it is sensitive and is able to react to its abuse

27 Ukrainian artists","this exhibition presents the wealth of ukrainian photography throughout five decades it begins in the 70s at the moment when ukrainian visual art began to publicly express its own language and ends with the war that engulfs the country now
for centuries ukraine has been continuously fighting for its own identity freedom language and state borders the eastern part joined the then forming soviet union after the revolution in 19171918 while the western part joined by military force in 1939

the ukrainian socialist republic went through a long period of eradicating national identity and formation of new images new symbols propaganda and new ‘soviet’ identity old narratives were destroyed historical facts were manipulated and those who did not share the new ideology eliminated literally or by silencing their voices through deportations and other means

when the soviet union fell ukraine declared its independence on august 24 1991 a new stage of development and restoration of the lost identity began

‘ukraine – the path to freedom’ looks at the period of the country’s independence from the first attempts at a revolution in its photographic language in the 70s to the present day it visualizes key events in the history of ukraine and looks at the development of photography during this period the exhibition aims to show how the sociopolitical and artistic life in the country are intimately connected

the show consists of four parts corresponding to four recent historical periods and offers the works of several generations of ukrainian authors it shows how photography acts on multiple social levels as a method of recording changes as a form of protest a personal story a reflection on events and a political statement

art is a mirror of society and especially photography can be a means towards deeper cultural understanding and engagement it tells us how ukraine is travelling along a historical path of struggle for freedom for its borders the right to exist culture and future as recent events prove the price of this struggle is high

in the video portraits the six interviewees address the audience directly they complement each other they sometimes contradict each other and it turns out that not everyone agrees with each other it is clear that ‘the groninger’ does not exist the communities in groningen are diverse and made up of individuals who all deal with what the earthquakes have brought in an individual way in any case it is clear from all the conversations that the earthquakes are not the problem the problem is how the consequences are dealt with

these photographs brings a future vision of sustainable crop rotations to life agroforestry systems precision agriculture and soil
regeneration techniques the images depict the landscape almost as unreal movie sets where the emphasis seems to be on all kinds of
technical developments that seemingly allow one to gain control over various natural processes the images eddo hartmann made for this project provide a critical look at the current belief in farreaching innovation technological developments are often still aimed at maximizing retums to actually tackle climate change a different approach is required that includes not only technological advances but also changes in behavior we must become aware of the impact of our own actions and be willing to adjust our behaviors

with regenerate as its theme noorderlicht
international photo festival here refers to the desire for a healthy relationship with nature and an active attitude that contributes to strengthening the health and resilience of nature this can be done in various ways sometimes by actively intervening sometimes by taking a step back and trusting the restorative power of nature itself the ultimate goal is to keep our world livable
our instinctive relationship with nature encourages us to do so people still feel a deep emotional connection with nature of which we are a part like all other living beings on this earth it is invaluable that we realise this especially in the western world where everything has to be more and more individualistic material faster and more efficient we sometimes forget this in the global ecosystem all life is interconnected with this idea in mind the festival wants to use the exhibited works to ask questions about where we want to go and in what way about the time we live in and the time yet to come
noorderlicht international photo festival 2023 started in friesland and is now moving across groningen and
drenthe the festival has been a biennial for two years and offers exhibitions throughout the northern netherlands on various dates from now until early december

relationship with our immediate environment ourselves and the world we live in we therefore look at the festival from three perspectives regenerate life
