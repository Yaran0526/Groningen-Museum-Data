0.0,Groninger Museum,2019.0,In the Ploeg Pavilion,"a collective of artists from groningen

in 1918 several young artists take the initative to found the art collective known as de ploeg meaning both “the plough” and “the group” this name was carefully selected art in groningen was like undeveloped land and needed to be ploughed thoroughly before something new could grow by joining forces and organizing shared expositions and other activities groningen could be prepared for modern art

de ploeg
everything about de ploeg
here you can find information about de ploeg the artists the history and development of the group references to collections and highlights
de ploeg was founded in 1918 in response to the artistic climate in the city of groningen a number of younger artists believed that the opportunities to exhibit and develop were too limited they hoped to be able to organize exhibitions of de ploeg members and also to introduce artists and the public to the latest developments in the field of visual art architecture literature in the form of exhibitions and lectures the initiators included jan wiegers johan dijkstra george martens and jan altink the latter came up with the name for the association he decided that a lot of ground had to be cultivated in groningen with regard to modern art and therefore proposed the name de ploeg meaning the plough

the association did not have a substantive program anyone who engaged in serious art could join from the beginning de ploeg therefore had members who worked in completely different directions and styles

although de ploeg continued to exist  and still exists  as an association its arthistorical significance lies in the 1920s when within its ranks an expressionist and impressionist trend was successively developed characterized by a close connection to the groningen region as well as international artistic orientation the most important artists who were members of de ploeg during that period include jan wiegers jan altink johan dijkstra hendrik werkman george martens jan jordens jan van der zee and job hansen
soon led by jan wiegers a group of painters within de ploeg was formed that found inspiration in expressionism from 1922 they left an emphatic mark on all association activities although his style was already developing towards expressionism wiegers converted to expressionism permanently during his sojourn in switzerland in 19201921 due to illness wiegers stayed in davos where he met ernst ludwig kirchner the most prominent representative of german expressionism kirchner’s personality and style made a decisive impression on wiegers when having returned to groningen wiegers introduced expressionism and gave a new direction to the artictic style of de ploeg at his request artists such as altink dijkstra werkman and martens gave in to experiments with colour wax paint and expressive forms of graphic art

de ploegs expressionism can be traced back to the work of artists such as vincent van gogh edvard munch and piet van wijngaerdt but found her artistic grammar in the work of kirchner the period in which groningen expressionism set the tone within de ploeg lasted only briefly around 1926 wiegers and altink moderated their colour palette and dijkstra returned to a more impressionistic way of working about three years later werkman who had less emphatically engaged with kirchner’s style developed his own expressionist painting but was mainly concerned with his printing initially with the help of his hand press later using stamping and stencil techniques he produced his famous prints which were both figurative and abstract
under the influence of jan altink a second period arose around 1927 in which a clearly recognizable school within de ploeg was leading it was impressionistic in nature and characterized by an extremely expressive brushwork and a light and transparent use of colour the most startling results in this direction were achieved by altink and job hansen the latter developed his own painting technique in which diluted oil paint was spread on prepared panels in an almost watercolourlike manner

the way in which expressiveness was determined in his work by the painters material pointed forward to the experimental and abstract expressionist forms of art that would develop after world war ii
constructivism which developed from 1923 in the work of wobbe alkema jan van der zee and in the printing art of hendrik werkman was an independent school within modern art in groningen unlike expressionism this style did not develop into an important trend within de ploeg because van der zee ultimately worked only in a constructivist way for one year werkman also worked in an expressionist style wobbe alkema the only constructivist by conviction was only a member of de ploeg for less than a year in 19241925 most of his work was created outside de ploeg",2018.1-2025.3

7.0,Groninger Museum,2019.0,Daan Roosegaarde - Presence,"the groninger museum presented daan roosegaarde – presence the artist and innovator’s first major museum solo project roosegaarde developed this groundbreaking new interactive artwork specially for the groninger museum where he previously displayed his work in the external public domain the artist now adopted the internal museum space for the first time with a largescale phosphorescent landscape which changes colour and shape because of the presence of visitors
unlike most exhibitions which demand that art should be viewed from a distance this installation encourages physical interaction roosegaarde is known for icoon afsluitdijk and international projects like waterlicht and smog free tower as a pioneer of the landscape of the future he investigates the concept of the dutch word ‘schoonheid’ in its dual meaning – beautiful and clean – which takes shape in new social core values like clean air clean water and clean energy presence envisioned this theme by using new materials and principles of physics evoking visitors to become aware of their own presence in a unique manner

living lab
presence was an 800 m2 living lab although the installation is the result of innovative materialtechnical research it comes across as highly intuitive different areas allowed visitors to experience various changes in perspective – from large and solid to small and mobile from dark to bright in one gallery futuristic spheres drew lines on the floor another seemed filled with luminous stardust calling to mind a vast city seen from an airplane other rooms appear to scan visitors by recording their presence in silhouettes and patterns the interaction between visitor and work created constantly changing visual impressions not only looking and observing but most of all touching feeling and moving were essential
inspiration
climate change and a desire to improve the landscape inspired roosegaarde to make presence in the work visitors’ traces which eventually disappear to make room for new ones symbolise the impact of humans’ presence on earth roosegaarde “you make the work and the work makes you the effect of your presence makes you aware of your relationship with the environment and how we can influence it” another source of inspiration was the landscape and environment art of the 1960s and ’70s in which interactivity and awareness of the earth’s vulnerability played an important role too these artists made outdoor landscapes an integral part of their art roosegaarde however took a new step by taking his landscape inside of the museum walls
daan roosegaarde
daan roosegaarde 1979 nieuwkoop is known for his innovative designs for public space which bring together social design art and biotechnology he characterises his work as ‘technopoetry’ a blend of technology and creativity that blurs the boundaries between the humanities and the sciences and is according to the artist the engine that drives social change working with a team of designers engineers and project managers he investigates subjects such as the relationship between humans and technology between the digital and the physical and between living and nonliving matter natural phenomena such as luminous jellyfish and fireflies fascinate him and the element of light frequently plays a key role in his work as we see in projects like waterlicht smog free tower icoon afsluitdijk and in presence

groninger museum
presence was a pioneering project not only for roosegaarde but also for the groninger museum with visitors actively influencing the look of the installation it experimented with art and design and spurs us to rethink the concept of ‘the exhibition’ this innovative hybrid show builds on the groninger museums ambition of focusing on the boundaries where art design fashion and technology meet presence was developed with the curators suean van der zijpp and mark wilson

drawing with rembrandt
if you wanted to be an artist back in the golden age you would have to study under a professional artist rembrandt accepted pupils quite early on he taught them to work in his own style as their first lesson his students would have to copy etchings drawings and paintings by his hand drawings were mainly used as studies in his studio which is why they are rarely signed that makes it hard to distinguish rembrandts drawings from those of his students

real or not
none of the drawings in the collection of the groninger museum are part of the core group not all of them are attributed to rembrandt anymore either the drawings were compared to the core drawings in terms of technique style and subject matter sometimes it helps to analyse the used materials such as the paper although most of the time ownership is determined by taking a close look at the work if you study the drawing materials work methods and stylistic markers you will find subtle differences or uncomfortable aspects in the drawings – in the exhibition you can spot them too",2019.6-2019.12
