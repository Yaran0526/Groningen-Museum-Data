The permanent exhibition invites you to become acquainted with the stories that connect history and current events. With digital storytelling, personal stories come to life.

 

The Jewish rituals, customs and festivals form a common thread through the building. DIY objects allow you to interactively experience why Shabbat is celebrated weekly, what Passover and Hanukkah mean, and how the dietary laws of Kashrut ensure a kosher Jewish household.

​

Naturally, the special architecture and the remarkable history of the building are highlighted. In the audio tour, Bertien Minco takes you along the moments in her family history in which the synagogue in the Folkingestraat and the Jewish community in Groningen are present.

The synagogue is naturally a place of remembrance, as well as a lively place for cultural activities and an educational center about Jewish religion and customs. Of course the Jewish Community holds shul here.

The new interior has become part of the striking monument, the permanent exhibition a source for further exploration of the rich history of Jewish Groningen.

Why were there so many small Jewish communities in the Groningen-East Frisian border region? And what was the reason for migration? Today it is hard to imagine that there were lively Jewish communities in Bunde, Jemgum, Weener, but also in Nieuweschans, Winschoten and Bourtange. Unlike in Germany, in some Dutch villages the former synagogues still remind us of this lost life. From Leer, Dr Juliane Irma Mihan worked on the scientific research, which resulted in the book in 2021  Jewish life in the border area.  Part of the research has been incorporated into the traveling exhibition that will arrive in Synagoge Groningen from July 2021, via Weener, Bunde, Winschoten and Bourtange, which will eventually arrive in Synagogue Groningen in December 2021.",2018-2021

In her paintings we meet faces that have been through a lot, eyes that look at you piercingly as if they want to tell you something. They take you away and invite you into their world, where there is room for pain and comfort, fear and hope. Even if the subject matter is heavy - like the work about World War II - people experience hope
and light. The current work has become much lighter in terms of colour. There is a lot of joy in it! This exhibition is realised in cooperation with Museum Sjoel Elburg. We are raising additional funding for this exhibition.",2023.6-2023.10

146,Synagogue,2024,Travel to Jewish East Frisia,"“Journey to Jewish East Frisia” is a joint project of around twenty cultural institutions on the East Frisian Peninsula that are committed to the visibility of Jewish life in East Frisia. In 2013, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the 1938 Progrom Night in Germany, a total of seventeen institutions, including nine museums and almost all former synagogue communities, came together to form a working group.

Since then, the network, which has been able to win over more and more people and institutions over the years, has met regularly under the lead organization of the East Frisian Landscape Cultural Agency. After the National Socialists came to power, Jewish culture in East Frisia disappeared remarkably quickly from the everyday life of Jews and non-Jews, compared to the rest of Germany. The project “Journey to Jewish East Frisia” is reminiscent of the once vibrant Jewish life in the region.

This happens through the diverse commitment of the network partners. The various projects impressively show how a topic can be viewed from very different perspectives. However, everyone is particularly concerned with giving a face to the diverse Jewish life in East Frisia up to the Shoah and beyond. Because shared memory is a path to healing and thus reconciliation.",##
