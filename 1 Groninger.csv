0,Groninger Museum,2019,In the Ploeg Pavilion,"A collective of artists from Groningen

In 1918, several young artists take the initative to found the art collective known as De Ploeg (meaning both “the Plough” and “the Group”). This name was carefully selected: art in Groningen was like undeveloped land and needed to be ploughed thoroughly before something new could grow. By joining forces and organizing shared expositions and other activities, Groningen could be prepared for modern art.

DE PLOEG
Everything about De Ploeg
Here you can find information about De Ploeg, the artists, the history and development of the group, references to collections and highlights.
De Ploeg was founded in 1918 in response to the artistic climate in the city of Groningen. A number of younger artists believed that the opportunities to exhibit and develop were too limited. They hoped to be able to organize exhibitions of De Ploeg members, and also to introduce artists and the public to the latest developments in the field of visual art, architecture, literature in the form of exhibitions and lectures. The initiators included Jan Wiegers, Johan Dijkstra, George Martens and Jan Altink. The latter came up with the name for the association He decided that a lot of ground had to be cultivated in Groningen with regard to modern art and therefore proposed the name De Ploeg, meaning the plough.

The association did not have a substantive program: anyone who engaged in ""serious"" art could join. From the beginning, De Ploeg therefore had members who worked in completely different directions and styles.

Although De Ploeg continued to exist - and still exists - as an association, its art-historical significance lies in the 1920s, when within its ranks an expressionist and impressionist trend was successively developed, characterized by a close connection to the Groningen region as well as international artistic orientation. The most important artists who were members of De Ploeg during that period include: Jan Wiegers, Jan Altink, Johan Dijkstra, Hendrik Werkman, George Martens, Jan Jordens, Jan van der Zee and Job Hansen.
Soon, led by Jan Wiegers, a group of painters within De Ploeg was formed that found inspiration in expressionism. From 1922 they left an emphatic mark on all association activities. Although his style was already developing towards expressionism, Wiegers converted to expressionism permanently during his sojourn in Switzerland in 1920-1921. Due to illness, Wiegers stayed in Davos, where he met Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, the most prominent representative of German Expressionism. Kirchner’s personality and style made a decisive impression on Wiegers. When having returned to Groningen Wiegers introduced expressionism and gave a new direction to the artictic style of De Ploeg. At his request, artists such as Altink, Dijkstra, Werkman and Martens gave in to experiments with colour, wax paint and expressive forms of graphic art.

De Ploeg's expressionism can be traced back to the work of artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Edvard Munch and Piet van Wijngaerdt, but found her artistic grammar in the work of Kirchner. The period in which Groningen expressionism set the tone within De Ploeg lasted only briefly. Around 1926 Wiegers and Altink moderated their colour palette and Dijkstra returned to a more impressionistic way of working about three years later. Werkman, who had less emphatically engaged with Kirchner’s style, developed his own expressionist painting, but was mainly concerned with his printing. Initially with the help of his hand press, later using stamping and stencil techniques, he produced his famous prints, which were both figurative and abstract.
Under the influence of Jan Altink, a second period arose around 1927 in which a clearly recognizable school within De Ploeg was leading. It was impressionistic in nature and characterized by an extremely expressive brushwork and a light and transparent use of colour. The most startling results in this direction were achieved by Altink and Job Hansen. The latter developed his own painting technique, in which diluted oil paint was spread on prepared panels in an almost watercolour-like manner.

The way in which expressiveness was determined in his work by the painter's material pointed forward to the experimental and abstract expressionist forms of art that would develop after World War II.
Constructivism, which developed from 1923 in the work of Wobbe Alkema, Jan van der Zee and in the printing art of Hendrik Werkman, was an independent school within modern art in Groningen. Unlike expressionism, this style did not develop into an important trend within De Ploeg, because Van der Zee ultimately worked only in a constructivist way for one year; Werkman also worked in an expressionist style. Wobbe Alkema, the only constructivist by conviction, was only a member of De Ploeg for less than a year (in 1924-1925). Most of his work was created outside De Ploeg.",2018.1-2025.3
1,Groninger Museum,2019,Collection of the Groninger Museum,"The Groninger Museum’s collection is fascinatingly varied. Get acquainted with suffragette Aletta Jacobs through a portrait painted by Isaac Israëls, discover the expressionism of Groningen’s De Ploeg artists, and be surprised by the striking designs of the Memphis group. A gleaming trove of Groningen silver, with a miniature Martini tower as its highlight, greets you in the Treasure Room. And of course there’s plenty of local history and culture too.",2018.1-2025.3
2,Groninger Museum,2019,Memphis Design,"Memphis Design One evening in December 1980 Italian designer Ettore Sottsass convened an international group of young designers. This was the moment when the Memphis group came into existence. Their goal was to create exciting designs with bright colors, asymmetrical shapes and with combinations of cheap and expensive materials. Memphis gave the Groninger Museum the impetus for a new collection area: modern design. Ten years later Alessandro Mendini, who also designed for Memphis, created the building of the Groninger Museum in this style. The Memphis design collection of the Groninger Museum In the exhibition The Collection, one room is completely filled with the cheerfully colored design of Memphis and Mendini. The poetic appearance the bright colors, playful shapes and decorations of the furniture, glass and lamps evoke all kinds of associations. Humor and irony also play an important role in Memphis design.",2018.1-2025.3
3,Groninger Museum,2019,Grand Stairwell Installation,"Chihuly’s Grand Stairwell Installation comprises 70 red, orange, and yellow exotic glass forms, known as Persians, in a composition which covers the three walls of the 12-metre-high stairwell. The installation can be seen from the museum’s different floors as well as from the staircase. Audience members quickly expressed a wish that the museum would purchase the work. The Groninger Museum is delighted and proud to have obtained sufficient support to make that wish come true.
Dale Chihuly about Grand Stairwell Installation
“Presenting my solo exhibition, CHIHULY, at the Groninger Museum was a major honor. Not only was it my largest exhibition ever in a European museum and an opportunity to share my work with an entirely new audience, but the institution’s aesthetic itself is so inspiring. I love its colorful and interesting spaces – the result of an architectural collaboration led by Alessandro Mendini – and I’m pleased to know that my Grand Stairwell Installation will have a permanent home in this space that I so admire.”
The Groninger Museum hosted Dale Chihuly’s largest major European exhibition in winter 2018/19. Deemed “bold” by the daily national newspaper NRC, the show met with unprecedented success, drawing 156,000 enthusiastic visitors. One of the exhibition’s highlights was a large installation designed for the museum’s staircase.
Chihuly understands the power of architecture and how each line, colour, and form interacts with a space to play a part in an installation’s overall success. Never before has the stairwell area been used to such impressive effect. The Groninger Museum’s collection is rich in technically advanced, exuberant works in which artists challenge the boundaries of their disciplines. The Grand Stairwell Installation continues this tradition and will remain on permanent display. It harmonises with François Morellet’s neon installation in the foyer and the interiors designed by Studio Job, Jaime Hayon, and Maarten Baas. Chihuly’s work adds a new dimension to a colourful, eccentric building.

CHIHULY
Dale Chihuly is an American artist noted for revolutionizing the studio glass movement and elevating perceptions of the glass medium. Known for ambitious architectural installations in cities, museums, and gardens around the world, Chihuly utilizes a variety of media to realize his creative vision, including glass, paint, charcoal, neon, ice, and Polyvitro. Chihuly’s work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide, including Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum and Corning Museum of Glass. Major exhibitions include Chihuly Over Venice (1995-96), Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem (1999), de Young Museum in San Francisco (2008), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2011), Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond (2012), Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, Canada (2013), Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada (2016), Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas (2017), Groninger Museum, Groningen, Netherlands (2018), and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, U.K (2019). Chihuly Garden and Glass, a long-term exhibition located at the Seattle Center, opened in 2012.

Persians
Featured in many of Chihuly’s most dramatic installations, Persians arose out of an exploration of form and colour. The series’ asymmetric and swirling forms evoke an ancient sensibility and when grouped together, form a mysterious, enchanting whole. Originally presented on pedestals, the series’ dramatic compositions have evolved to include large-scale installations mounted on walls, overhead in ceilings, and assembled together in the form of chandeliers and towers.

Sponsors
The work’s purchase would not have been possible without the support of foundations and private donors. On behalf of the public, the museum thanks the following sponsors: the Vereniging Rembrandt, partly via its Titus Fonds, its Themafonds Glas its Innorosa Fonds, its Groninger Fonds,; the Mondriaan Fund; the De Marees van Swinderen-de Blocq van Scheltinga bequest; the Van Os-Van Calcar bequest; the Groninger Museum Salon; the BankGiro Loterij; Reineke Bennema & Willem Bok; and Het Singeldorp.",2019.5-2024.12
4,Groninger Museum,2019,Pronkjewails - Design From Past and Present,"For the museum building’s 25th anniversary, guest curator John Veldkamp decorates the Starck Pavilion with ceramic and glass objects from past eras and the present day. The exhibition illustrates the Groninger Museum’s collecting history while treating visitors to original combinations of splendid objects arranged in masterly still lifes.

John Veldkamp
Veldkamp owned the renowned design store John John’s, which operated for more than 30 years on Oude Kijk in ’t Jatstraat in Groningen. In the 1980s, he encouraged the Groninger Museum’s then director, Frans Haks, to start collecting contemporary design.
Royal Blood
The still lifes below are inspired by the artwork ‘Marie Antoinette’ (3) by Erwin Olaf, which is part of his series ‘Royal Blood’. The first still life (left) is inspired by the name Royal Blood. The doll is holding a harakiri knife with an Imari handle. The plate on the right is called ‘milk and blood’ and all the objects are in the colour red. The second still life (right) is inspired by our own royal family: the House of Orange. The initials of our king are painted on the two plates and the little bowl is made out of silver Queen Elizabeth coins. In 1942 it was forbidden to use these silver coins, so people made these objects as a silent protest. This was a way of showing you were pro Dutch. As usually only items like spoons or brooches were made, the size of this object is very rare.",2019.4-2022.8
5,Groninger Museum,2019,Mondo Mendini,"Twenty-five years after the opening of the Groninger Museum building he designed, Alessandro Mendini (1931–2019) was given free rein to put together his dream exhibition. Shortly before his death earlier this year, the grand old man of Italian design selected dozens of his own revolutionary designs as well as works by numerous other artists and designers. Mendini passionately believed in collaboration between creative spirits and the importance of imagination. Mondo Mendini is a colourful, dazzling riot of fine art, design and architecture.

6,Groninger Museum,2019,P. Struycken,"Peter Struycken’s (b. 1939, The Hague) 2007 installation for the Coop Himmelb(l)au Pavilion, based on the French composer Pierre Boulez’s musical work …explosante-fixe…, went on view again in 2019. Five large screens scattered through the darkened gallery took visitors on a journey full of changing colours and forms, by turns intense and serene. The work was shown alternately with a new installation based on Alexander Scriabin’s dramatic symphony Prometheus: The Poem of Fire.
In Museum Estate Wijlre (Zuid-Limburg)
P. Struycken – Colour: Profusion and Variability
10.03.2019 — 10.11.2019

On the occasion of P. Struycken's eightieth birthday, Kasteel Wijlre estate realised a unique transformation of the Hedge House. The transformation consists of a painting that covers all of the building's floors, walls and ceiling. The red, black and white areas of colour will change the experience of the architecture of Wiel Arets, who designed the Hedge House. Struycken has never before realised a painted work on this scale, and for the first time, the Hedge House is using its space for a spatially all-encompassing artwork.
Alongside the transformation of the Hedge House, a solo exhibition of Struycken will also take place in the estate's Coach House.",2019.6-2020.2
7,Groninger Museum,2019,Daan Roosegaarde - Presence,"The Groninger Museum presented Daan Roosegaarde – Presence: the artist and innovator’s first major museum solo project. Roosegaarde developed this groundbreaking new interactive artwork specially for the Groninger Museum. Where he previously displayed his work in the external public domain, the artist now adopted the internal museum space for the first time, with a large-scale, phosphorescent landscape which changes colour and shape because of the presence of visitors.
Unlike most exhibitions, which demand that art should be viewed from a distance, this installation encourages physical interaction. Roosegaarde is known for Icoon Afsluitdijk and international projects like Waterlicht and Smog Free Tower. As a pioneer of the landscape of the future, he investigates the concept of the Dutch word ‘schoonheid’ in its dual meaning – beautiful and clean – which takes shape in new social core values like clean air, clean water and clean energy. Presence envisioned this theme by using new materials and principles of physics, evoking visitors to become aware of their own presence in a unique manner.

Living lab
Presence was an 800 m2 living lab. Although the installation is the result of innovative material-technical research, it comes across as highly intuitive. Different areas allowed visitors to experience various changes in perspective – from large and solid to small and mobile, from dark to bright. In one gallery, futuristic spheres drew lines on the floor. Another seemed filled with luminous stardust, calling to mind a vast city seen from an airplane. Other rooms appear to scan visitors by recording their presence in silhouettes and patterns. The interaction between visitor and work created constantly changing visual impressions. Not only looking and observing but, most of all, touching, feeling and moving were essential.
Inspiration
Climate change and a desire to improve the landscape inspired Roosegaarde to make Presence. In the work, visitors’ traces, which eventually disappear to make room for new ones, symbolise the impact of humans’ presence on earth. Roosegaarde: “You make the work and the work makes you. The effect of your presence makes you aware of your relationship with the environment and how we can influence it.” Another source of inspiration was the landscape and environment art of the 1960s and ’70s in which interactivity and awareness of the earth’s vulnerability played an important role too. These artists made outdoor landscapes an integral part of their art; Roosegaarde however, took a new step by taking his landscape inside of the museum walls.
Daan Roosegaarde
Daan Roosegaarde (1979, Nieuwkoop) is known for his innovative designs for public space, which bring together social design, art and (bio-)technology. He characterises his work as ‘techno-poetry’: a blend of technology and creativity that blurs the boundaries between the humanities and the sciences and is, according to the artist, the engine that drives social change. Working with a team of designers, engineers and project managers, he investigates subjects such as the relationship between humans and technology, between the digital and the physical, and between living and nonliving matter. Natural phenomena such as luminous jellyfish and fireflies fascinate him and the element of light frequently plays a key role in his work, as we see in projects like Waterlicht, Smog Free Tower, Icoon Afsluitdijk, and in Presence.

Groninger Museum
Presence was a pioneering project not only for Roosegaarde but also for the Groninger Museum, with visitors actively influencing the look of the installation. It experimented with art and design and spurs us to rethink the concept of ‘the exhibition’. This innovative hybrid show builds on the Groninger Museum's ambition of focusing on the boundaries where art, design, fashion and technology meet. Presence was developed with the curators Sue-an van der Zijpp and Mark Wilson

Book
In conjunction with the exhibition, the renowned art book publisher Phaidon launched the English-language monograph Daan Roosegaarde. Lecturis simultaneously published a Dutch translation. The book features contributions by Nico Daswani of the World Economic Forum, Fumio Nanjo of Mori Arts Museum in Tokyo, Carol Becker of Columbia University in New York, and Daan Roosegaarde.",2019.6-2020.1
8,Groninger Museum,2019,Friends for Life,"For 40 years, the Friends of the Groninger Museum have been helping the museum to purchase works for its collection. To mark the anniversary, the museum is exhibiting a selection of these acquisitions. The show encompasses a wide range of objects, from centuries-old art to commercial design, from modern and contemporary art to craft. They’ve all got one thing in common: every piece has a Groningen connection.",2019.9-2020.1
9,Groninger Museum,2019,Rembrandt?!,"2019 is the year of Rembrandt van Rijn (Leiden 1606-1669 Amsterdam): it has been exactly 350 years since this world-famous Dutch painter passed away. Over the course of his life he created an estimated 350 paintings, 374 etchings and 1500 - 2000 drawings. The authenticity of Rembrandt's work is still a common discussion point within the art world. Nowadays, only 78 drawings can be attributed to Rembrandt with high certainty, thanks to their signature or contemporary sources. This core group now functions as a key in indentifying his other drawings.

Drawing with Rembrandt
If you wanted to be an artist back in the Golden Age, you would have to study under a professional artist. Rembrandt accepted pupils quite early on. He taught them to work in his own style. As their first lesson, his students would have to copy etchings, drawings and paintings by his hand. Drawings were mainly used as studies in his studio, which is why they are rarely signed. That makes it hard to distinguish Rembrandt's drawings from those of his students.

Real or not
None of the drawings in the collection of the Groninger Museum are part of the core group. Not all of them are attributed to Rembrandt (anymore) either. The drawings were compared to the 'core drawings' in terms of technique, style and subject matter. Sometimes it helps to analyse the used materials, such as the paper, although most of the time ownership is determined by taking a close look at the work. If you study the drawing materials, work methods, and stylistic markers, you will find subtle differences or uncomfortable aspects in the drawings – In the exhibition you can spot them too.",2019.6-2019.12

11,Groninger Museum,2019,Struggle! 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage.,"In 2019 the Netherlands celebrated 100 years of universal voting rights. The Groninger Museum payed homage to this historic occasion with Struggle! 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage. The exhibition illustrated how years of activism ultimately resulted in victory for the women’s suffrage movement in the Netherlands: in 1919, a new law decreed both men and women had the right to vote.

Exhibition
The Groninger Museum presented a detailed overview of the turbulent history of the struggle for women’s suffrage in the Netherlands, in which doctor Aletta Jacobs, from Groningen, played a prominent role. The exhibition showed the broad support the movement enjoyed throughout this country: after the Women’s Suffrage Association was founded in 1894, active chapters sprang up in even the smallest villages. The movement was not just a local phenomenon but a worldwide one, and Dutch activists were important partners in the international struggle. The show surveys the numerous developments around women’s suffrage over the years and demonstrates how the fight for gender equality continues today.

Through banners, photographs, cartoons, paintings and historical documents, Struggle! 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage illustrated how the activists fought for their cause. One highlight of the exhibition was a 1911 banner of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance made by the famous Stockholm textile association Handarbetets Vänner. Another was the article amending the law, on loan from the National Archives of the Netherlands.

Events
Around the country, a comprehensive programme of events highlighting history, art, theatre, scholarship and activism celebrated 100 years of women’s suffrage in the Netherlands. Groningen servedas the centre of the festivities. On 9 May 2019, the 100th anniversary of the House of Representatives’ passing of the amendment, a lavish celebration featuring talks, film, theatre and music took place at the Groninger Museum.

Curators
The exhibition was curated by Mineke Bosch, professor of modern history at the University of Groningen, and Egge Knol, history curator at the Groninger Museum. A richly illustrated book written by Bosch to accompany the exhibition was published on 9 May 2019.",2019.4-2019.9

14,Groninger Museum,2019,CHIHULY,"An exhibition of sensational glass creations by world-renowned American artist Dale Chihuly, was on display in the Groninger Museum. Comprising 16 installations, the exhibition providds a comprehensive overview of the artist’s body of work. It was specially curated for the museum, in partnership with the Seattle-based Chihuly Studio, and was the artist’s largest European museum show in the last 20 years. Showing work created throughout Chihuly’s five-decade career in both indoor and outdoor settings. Highlights of the multi-media exhibition included the artist’s most recent works, Rotolo and Glass on Glass, along with his innovative Baskets, dramatic installations of Neon, Fiori and Icicles, and demonstrations of creative communication-style.

About Dale Chihuly
Dale Chihuly (b. 1941, Tacoma, Washington) is known for revolutionizing the studio glass movement and elevating perceptions of glass. Over his 50-year career, he has become known for his iconic sculptures in glass, a medium that appeals to him because it is one of the few materials that transmits light. Durable yet fragile and breakable, glass continues to challenge Chihuly as he keeps pushing the material’s boundaries with regard to shape and scale. Glass, however, is just one of the mediums he employs to realise his vision: he also draws and paints and has created large-scale installations with materials including neon, ice, and Polyvitro – a plastic material with similar visual properties to glass.

Outdoor displays
Works were not only on view inside, but outside the Groninger Museum building as well. Two works were displayed outdoors: Red Reeds (2010), containing stalks stretching up to three meters high that are composed of red glass blown in Finland, and Neon 206 (2017), glass tubes in angular forms that were filled with neon and argon gasses and charged with electricity.

Series
The exhibition also contained works from series such as Venetians (1988-2006), a fusion of American exuberance and Italian bravura in glass; Cylinders (2006-2016), glass works adorned with intricate glass-thread drawings inspired and accompanied by Chihuly’s collection of Native American textiles; and Rotolo (2015-2018), one of Chihuly’s most technically challenging series consisting of sculptures of which the heaviest in the exhibition contains 43 kilos of glass.

Special design for Groninger Museum
Furthermore, CHIHULY presented a new installation specially designed for the exhibition in the Groninger Museum: Grand Stairwell Installation (2018). It included the largest Persians – a series of irregularly shaped and boldly coloured forms – ever made: 1.4 meters in diameter.

Fax Wall
CHIHULY not only gave an overview of the artist’s impressive oeuvre, but offered insight into his creative process and communication style too. The exhibition for example included Fax Wall: an installation consisting of letters written by the artist that were originally shared with his team via facsimile machines. Rarely seen in public, the faxes contained personal messages, artwork sketches, plans for exhibitions, installations, and more.

Royal touch
The exhibition at the Groninger Museum also had a royal touch. In 1997, then US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary visited The Hague to celebrate the 50th jubilee of the Marshall Plan. On this occasion, Bill Clinton presented then Queen of the Netherlands Beatrix with a special gift: Bottle Green Seaform with Marigold Lip Wrap (1997), made by Dale Chihuly. This green, wavy, shell-shaped sculpture is part of the Royal Collections of the Netherlands in The Hague and was the only non-American loan in the exhibition. Other works from the Seaform series – sculptures that evoke sea life – were displayed as well.

After the painter Jan Wiegers befriended the German artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner in 1920, the group entered a period of rapid artistic development. Kirchner heavily influenced the emergence of the colourful Groningen expressionist style. Though De Ploeg’s avant-garde intensity ebbed after 1928, they had indeed ploughed fertile new ground.

The work on view ranges from Diane Arbus’s and Larry Clark’s 1970s documentary photography, through Anton Corbijn’s and Catherine Opie’s portraits and Inez van Lamsweerde’s fashion work of the 1980s and 1990s, to Ruud van Empel’s and David LaChapelle’s staged scenes from the past decade.

The photographs address themes such as diversity, artificiality and identity and pose an overarching question: why do we increasingly look at ourselves through the imaginary lens of another?",2020.2-2020.10
22,Groninger Museum,2020,Printer in times of war - H.N. Werkman and de Blauwe Schuit,"Patriotism, perserverance, and hope for a better future; these are common themes in the prints of H.N Werkman for de Blauwe Schuit, founded at the end of 1940. Through prayers and Psalms as well as texts from the Jewish and Yiddish and modern poetry, the company reacts to the occupation.

De Blauwe Schuit was founded by Hendrik Nicolaas Werkman (1882-1945), pastor August Henkels, chemist Ate Zuithoff, and high school teacher Adri Buning. Hendrik Werkman was responsible for the typography and the colourful, occasionally exuberant illustrations in all the publications. For him and the other “Schippers van de Blauwe Schuit” (sailors of the blue barge), the publications are an outlet of personal resistance during the dark days of war.",2020.2-2020.10
23,Groninger Museum,2020,Willem Kolvoort - Posters for Vera,"This exhibition showcases the playful, imaginative, humorous screen prints of Willem Kolvoort, the well-known maker of posters for the Groningen live music club Vera. In more than three decades of working with Vera, Kolvoort has created more than 500 different posters. His designs are often cheeky, but also endearing, thanks to Kolvoort’s use of animal figures. The show will open shortly before the next edition of the music festival Eurosonic Noorderslag.

While many European pop venues use screen-printed posters to publicise events, Vera’s have been in a class of their own for years. Kolvoort’s are arguably the most characterful among them.

The exhibition comprises 36 screen prints selected by the artist. It will open on 10 January and run through 7 June 2020.

Book
A book will be published to coincide with the exhibition’s opening. Willem Kolvoort – 30 jaar Vera Posters (“Willem Kolvoort: 30 Years of Vera Posters”) provides a full overview of all Kolvoort’s posters for the venue. It also contains essays by the music journalist Peter van der Heide and the writer Bill Mensema.",2020.1-2020.9
24,Groninger Museum,2020,En tóch staat de Martini – 75 Years of Liberation in Groningen,"In April 1945, after five years of war, in which many of Groningen’s Jewish residents were deported and murdered, resistance fighters were imprisoned, tortured and executed, bombs devastated Groningen, and acute shortages took hold, the German forces tenaciously defended the occupied city. Despite the superior strength of the Canadian infantry, it took three days of heavy fighting to break the opposition. Artillery bombardments and raging fires partly destroyed the Grote Markt and ruined streets and houses. But Groningen was free.

The exhibition looks at the war but keeps the focus on liberation.

The film accompanies the exhibition ‘En tóch staat de Martini - 75 years of liberation of Groningen’. It tells the story of the war and liberation of Groningen, with quotes from war-journals and letters and it shows historical footage from the war.",2020.3-2020.9
25,Groninger Museum,2020,In Wall House #2: The Art of Waste,"The Art of Waste
Ten years ago, the “waste artist” Maria Koijck literally launched one of her best-known projects on the Hoornsemeer lake near Wall House #2: a three-metre-tall swan made from 15,000 plastic bottles. With the works in this exhibition, she aims to expand awareness of how we deal with waste. The creations, also made from plastic bottles, will be on view on the second storey of Wall House #2.

One floor below, fascinating finds from the nearby Friesche Veen wetland await. The educator and filmmaker Nick Landman discovered areas on the outskirts of Groningen that had served as dumping grounds in the distant past. He and the local historian Beno Hofman went in search of untold stories.

JR: Chronicles
The first major museum exhibition of the work of the French artist JR encompasses murals, films and countless photographs. It provides an overview of his career so far, from documentation of graffiti artists he produced as a teenager in Paris to his large-scale interventions in cities worldwide to his recent digitally collaged murals that serve as collective portraits of diverse publics.

This show is curated by the Brooklyn Museum in New York. For the occasion, the Groninger Museum will work with graffiti and street artists to create a series of portraits of local residents inside and outside the building. Part of the museum’s substantial street art
collection will also be on display.

Over the past two decades, JR has expanded the meaning of public art with his ambitious, socially engaged projects. As a photographer, he brings visibility to a broad spectrum of people and communities all over the world and shines a light on their problems. By focusing on these “invisible” people, he creates a platform for their stories. He reproduces their individual portraits at a monumental scale and wheatpastes them in public space, sometimes illegally. JR’s projects honour the voices of everyday people and demonstrate his commitment to community, cooperation and dialogue.

Portrait of a Generation
JR began his career in 2004 with the photo series Portrait of a Generation. It came about after the film director Ladj Ly invited JR to cooperate on a project in the Paris suburb of Montfermeil, where Ly lived at the time. The duo aimed to poke fun at the media's caricatured portrayal of young people in the banlieues. In the photo Ly appears to be pointing a gun at the viewer, but on closer inspection it proves to be a camera. When rioting broke out in the Paris suburbs in 2005 following the death of two youths, the photo was reproduced countless times in newspapers and on TV

Kikito (2017)
In response to the construction of a permanent wall between the United States and Mexico, JR created a massive installation in 2017 at the border fence in the Mexican city of Tecate. It consists of an image of Kikito, a toddler whose home in Tecate overlooks the wall. Lacking any awareness of politics, the curious little boy peeks playfully over the barrier from his side. The work symbolises the innocence of young immigrants. The day before it was due to be dismantled, JR organised a cross-border picnic. Kikito, his family and hundreds of guests from the United States and Mexico came together to share a meal. Gathered around a long table decorated with JR’s iconic eyes that extended across the fence, they ate the same food, drank the same water and listened to the same music. The border patrol came to stop the project and threatened to arrest all the guests, but when they saw the positive action with their own eyes, they decided not to.

Women Are Heroes (2007-present)
For another project, Women Are Heroes, JR travelled with his camera to shoot portraits of women in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya; Monrovia, Liberia; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Jaipur, India. The photographs emphasise the women's vitality, not their poverty. According to JR, it’s the women who sustain their communities, though the men are more visible on the streets. He pasted up the portraits in public spaces in the slums and elsewhere – on the walls of churches and mosques, on buses and trains, on the floor of an empty swimming pool. In the Nairobi slum of Kibera he affixed sheets of vinyl printed with photographs of women's eyes to the roofs of dozens of houses, instantly waterproofing them.

Inside Out (2011-present)
JR also won fame for Inside Out, an international art project which he announced during his TED Prize acceptance in March 2011. He invited members of the public to upload photographic self-portraits, which he then printed out and sent back so they could be pasted up locally. Over the past decade more than 400,000 people in more than 138 countries have taken part in the project.

Livestream Artist Talk JR February 2022 Groninger Museum
On 16 February, JR visited the Groninger Museum for the Artist Talk. The French artist, who is now showing JR: Chronicles, talked to Nadia Moussaid about his exhibition JR: Chronicles, about his artistry and why he always wears a hat and dark glasses.

Part of the Groningen artists’ collective from the beginning, she held several administrative positions from 1918. She met fellow member George Martens in the group and married him in 1922. After giving birth to two children, she became less active in De Ploeg. Her premature death put an end to her delicate, promising artistry. She left behind a relatively small oeuvre of oil paintings, watercolours, drawings and collages.

31,Groninger Museum,2022,Nymphenburg x Groninger Museum - Porcelain. Art. Design.,"Marrying art, design and craft, Porzellan Manufaktur Nymphenburg of Munich has been producing the finest porcelain, pure of form and entirely handmade, since the mid- 18th century. Working with the expert John Veldkamp, guest curator of Pronkjewails, the Groninger Museum will showcase the house's magnificent creations in dialogue with pieces from its own collection.

Porzellan Manufaktur Nymphenburg
This year marks the 275th anniversary of Munich’s Porzellan Manufaktur Nymphenburg. The company has won international fame for its fine porcelain, which is pure of form and entirely handmade. Porcelain is a refined, high-quality material, timeless and lasting yet simultaneously delicate and fragile.

Innovative, avant-garde art and design
The company’s reputation rests largely on the master modellers who have left their mark on the brand over the years. In addition, Nymphenburg has always been an innovator. Between its avant-garde business vision and its long tradition of craftsmanship, the factory has established a solid reputation in the art and design worlds. Nymphenburg continues to seek out interesting collaborations with today’s artists for the purpose of creating contemporary porcelain. It has partnered with the likes of the artist Damien Hirst, the photographer Nick Knight, and the prominent Dutch designers Hella Jongerius and Viktor & Rolf.

In dialogue
Over the centuries, Nymphenburg has successfully adapted to changing tastes in style and subject matter. In its focus on subjects including mythology, human beings, nature, and foreign cultures, it shares common ground with the Groninger Museum’s highly varied collection. Objects from the two collections will be presented side by side in the Starck Pavilion. Thus, their historical and visual links are further explored in an unexpected way.",2022.10-2024.5
32,Groninger Museum,2022,Gianni Versace Retrospective,"One of the most influential couturiers ever comes to life at the Groninger Museum in Gianni Versace Retrospective. This colourful, daring, emotional exhibition takes visitors inside the eccentric Italian fashion designer’s world of extravagant clothing and lavish catwalk shows in which clothing, pop music and design come spectacularly together. Gianni Versace was murdered 25 years ago, but his revolutionary spirit lives on in the fashion of today. From 3 December 2022 through 7 May 2023, the Groninger Museum honours Gianni Versace and his trailblazing designs.

Gianni Versace Retrospective showcases outfits, accessories, fabrics, drawings, interior designs, and footage of legendary shows harking back to the Italian designer’s glory days between 1989 and 1997, all testifying to his extraordinary creativity. Gianni Versace linked fashion with music, photography and graphic design and led the way in the transformation of fashion shows and advertising campaigns into works of art. He succeeded in bringing the arts together as no one had before. All the items in the exhibition are original pieces, sourced from international private collections.

Self-confidence and supermodels
Gianni Versace (1946–1997) was a pioneer in the fashion world. He challenged traditional images of masculinity and femininity, designing clothing for both sexes and referencing sexuality and power in his collections. As an openly gay man, he became a key figure in the LGBTQ movement. He also encouraged women to be self-confident enough not to hide their bodies. A clever marketer, Gianni Versace recruited celebrities to promote his brand. At the same time, he turned previously unknown models into superstars. Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford owe their supermodel status to him. He worked on his advertising campaigns with forward-looking photographers like Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton, Peter Lindbergh and Bruce Weber. Gianni Versace created a new status quo in the fashion industry.

Ancient Greece, pop art and bondage
Gianni Versace’s groundbreaking combinations and strong patterns sprang from his vast knowledge of visual culture and art history. He brought together classical and pop art imagery and found inspiration in figures from ancient Greece as well as subjects like bondage and SM. Gianni Versace worked with artists like Andy Warhol, Jim Dine and Julian Schnabel, raising the profile of the marriage between old and new like never before.

1997 murder
On 15 July 1997, Gianni Versace was murdered at age 50 in front of his house in Florida. He had left a unique mark on the fashion world and won multitudes of fans, and numerous pop stars and other prominent people, including Princess Diana and Elton John, attended his funeral. With his death, the fashion world lost one of its most important designers of the 20th century.",2022.12-2023.5

35,Groninger Museum,2022,Teun Hocks,"A small presentation in his memory
Last February, Teun Hocks passed away in his hometown Rotterdam at th e age of 74. Hocks was a pioneer in staged photography, a movement that was widely exhibited for the first time in 1986 through the exhibition Fotografia Buffa in the Groninger Museum. In 1999, Hocks also held a solo exhibition here.

A plodding anti-hero - that’s what they called the character Hocks invariably portrayed in his photographs. Alone in the world, tragicomic, melancholic, and treading the fine line between surrealism and slapstick. Hocks did not only play the leading part in his work every time, he also designed and painted his backdrops and took the photos himself by using a self-timer. The photo would then be enlarged in soft black and white tones and carefully coloured in with thinned oil paint.

“If people recognise this situation, I want to make them smile about the things that are actually a little bit painful. I hope that my work can bring some comfort this way.

1672 was a disastrous year for the Netherlands. The country was attacked from four different directions – from the sea by the British, from the south by France, and from the east by the German bishops of Münster and Cologne. Before long, most of the Netherlands was in enemy hands. Groningen was bombed for weeks, but it held out, and the Germans quietly withdrew on 27 August. The city’s preservation proved a turning point in that terrible year. The Relief of Groningen is still commemorated every 28 August.

In 2016, Olaf made a series of photographs for the Groninger Museum inspired by the sculptures of Auguste Rodin.

Erwin Olaf made his debut in the 1980s as a photojournalist but soon began specialising in studio photography. His studio work was characterised by a broad range of themes, which included sexuality, mortality, and an uncontrollable urge to shock the audience with humour and sarcasm.

When I’m dead, I think it would be a shame if nobody tries to see if I could be one of the immortals. But if that’s not possible, no hard feelings. Erwin Olaf",2023.10-2024.6

The Rolling Stones have helped to shape popular culture around the world. This exhibition of items loaned by the band provides a compelling behind-the-scenes look at how it all happened. It also considers the wider context of decades of cultural history through the work of artists, designers, performers and writers ranging from Andy Warhol, Shepard Fairey, Alexander McQueen and Ossie Clark to Jeff Koons and Martin Scorsese.

Andreas Blühm, director of the Groninger Museum: “We are extremely happy that we can bring the Rolling Stones back to Groningen after their legendary concert in 1999. The exhibition will trigger happy memories and provide new and deeper insight into a four-headed cultural phenomenon that shaped the 20th century and continues to do so.”

Ileen Gallagher, curator of the exhibition: ""The Rolling Stones exhibition is a celebration and thematic exploration of the band who defined rock and roll and the culture surrounding it for more than half of a century.

Joram Krol's approach
Joram Krol is known for his intense and personal portraits, often taken in Groningen. Around nine years ago, Joram got his hands on a camera. He began developing his signature photography style that allows him to put himself in the shoes of those who are in the pictures.

They won prizes, and their art hung on the walls of houses in Groningen. Years later, however, their work fell out of fashion, and art historians dismissed them as amateurs.

44,Groninger Museum,2023,The Art of Hipgnosis,"Their illustrations have decorated the walls of millions of teenage bedrooms since the 1970s. Yet many people have never heard of the London design studio Hipgnosis. Now the Groninger Museum is honouring the group, which designed legendary album covers for some of the world’s biggest rock acts, with its first ever major exhibition: The Art of Hipgnosis: Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel & 10cc.

An up-close look
Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, 10cc – these are just a few names on the impressive list of bands and musicians for whom the London studio Hipgnosis designed album covers during the heyday of vinyl. Many featured surrealist images, produced long before the invention of digital photography and Photoshop. The Art of Hipgnosis gives you an up-close look at the design, process and stories behind the most iconic album covers ever made.

“We didn’t have Photoshop. Everything had to be shot on film and done by hand. And average artwork could take three to six weeks, whereas you could do some of these album covers in an afternoon now.” - Aubrey ""Po"" Powell, founder of Hipgnosis, 2017, Rolling Stones

The album covers as art
The Dutch photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn’s documentary Squaring The Circle: The Story of Hipgnosis, which premiered recently, looks at how some of the cover designs came into being. Though Hipgnosis is known for colourful work, Corbijn chose to make his film in black-and-white, “except for the introduction of each sleeve,” he says. “Those are in colour, to show that they brought colour to the world.”

“Hipgnosis turned the visual interpretation of music into an art form,” says Groninger Museum director Andreas Blühm, who curated the exhibition with Hipgnosis founder Aubrey Powell. All the photographs and objects in The Art of Hipgnosis come from Powell's private archive.

The documentary is currently not on display in the Groninger Museum.

Tricks and tips
Anyone interested in learning more about this art form can pick up a few tricks at the Groninger Museum during The Art of Hipgnosis. The designers will be sharing their secrets in 14 steps. One lesson: sometimes a design fails. A selection of “outtakes” – sleeves rejected by artists including the Rolling Stones – will be on display along with the famous ones.

Eurosonic/Noorderslag
The opening of The Art of Hipgnosis coincides with Groningen’s annual international music event Eurosonic/Noorderslag (ESNS), taking place from 18 to 21 January 2023. ESNS is a conference devoted to European pop music and a showcase festival dedicated to the promotion and discovery of new European and Dutch music.

How are they transported and subsequently presented to the public? Behind the Scenes not only answers these questions, it gives visitors a chance to get involved. The exhibition is interactive and calls on visitors to get creative. They can choose which frame best suits a particular artwork or decide which lighting shows it off most effectively.

Stolen Van Gogh to go back on display
In 2020, Vincent van Gogh’s painting The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring was stolen from the Singer Laren museum. In 2023 came the joyful news that the painting had been recovered. After research by conservator Marjan de Visser at the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring will return to public view in Behind the Scenes at the Groninger Museum.

150 years of the Groninger Museum: how it all started
The Groninger Museum was born a century and a half ago in a small room in Groningen’s provincial government building. At that point it was simply a cabinet of curiosities. In 1894, it moved to Praediniussingel and became the Groninger Museum van Provinciale Oudheden (Groningen Museum of Provincial Antiquities). Today, visitors to central Groningen can’t miss the current building, a striking, colourful structure that rises up out of the water. Designed by Alessandro Mendini, it has housed the Groninger Museum since 1994. The collection has long since outgrown that small room and now contains more than 60,000 objects. More than 200,000 people visit the museum every year.",2024.3-2024.6
48,Groninger Museum,2024,New acquisitions: tapestries by Andrea Branzi and Koen Taselaar,"In the West oval room of the museum two playful tapestries and recent additions to the museum’s collection are on show. They are two tapestries by different artists, from different times and with very different representations. And yet they are related. Baletto Geometrico was created in 1980 by the Italian designer Andrea Branzi and Koen Taselaar created the wall hanging Radical Furniture for Radical Times five years ago.

In the one tapestry you see four dancing figures perform an abstract ballet and at the other you discover squids in a postmodern design interior. So very different, but each makes reference to other works of art. How are the two works of art connected?

Andrea Branzi
The tapestry on the right is by the Italian designer Andrea Branzi (1938–2023), a member of Alessandro Mendini’s circle. Branzi took the German Bauhaus artist Kurt Schmidt’s sketch for The Mechanical Ballet as his starting point. In Schmidt’s 1923 design, the dancers hide behind movable abstract planes. Schmidt wanted to bring an abstract painting to life on stage. Branzi, in turn, combines three art forms here: abstract art, theatre, and the craft of weaving.

Koen Taselaar
Koen Taselaar’s (b. 1986) Radical Furniture for Radical Times was purchased in 2020 but has just gone on display for the first time in the museum. Taselaar took inspiration in part from the Groninger Museum’s postmodern Italian design collection. The numerous recognisable items include furniture and lamps by Ettore Sottsass, Michele De Lucchi and Peter Shire – the “radical furniture” of the title. As for “radical times”, Taselaar had read that octopi could thrive in a warming world and hence might ultimately survive longer than humans. If the Groninger Museum should ever end up entirely under water, the creatures would find a cheerful home here.",2024.4-2024.9
49,Groninger Museum,2024,How Van Gogh Came to Groningen,"Not many people know it, but the Groninger Museum hosted one of the biggest ever Vincent Van Gogh exhibitions more than a century ago. The exhibition How Van Gogh Came to Groningen will tell the story of the determined Groningers and enterprising students who brought modern art to the northern Netherlands in the 1890s. The exhibition will open on 30 November 2024.

‘Who had ever seen such things?’

At the end of the 19th century, Groningen was a lively city full of new buildings and ideas. Travellers could take the train to the city for the first time and disembark at a brand new station. The population was growing, and the city was expanding. The Stadsschouwburg theatre was under construction, and the Groningen Museum of Antiquities had recently opened. In a bid to shake up the art world, six University of Groningen students – including Johan Huizinga, who would become a world-famous historian – organised eight spectacular exhibitions at the Groninger Museum in 1896 and 1897. Their efforts would prove pivotal for the development of modern art.

A craving for change

How Van Gogh Came to Groningen sparkles with bold, experimental personalities, people who transformed the zeitgeist and the culture. Like its 1896 predecessor, the show features work by the Dutch painter Jan Toorop, Belgian symbolists, and French printmakers including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec – all innovators who challenged the art establishment. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, Vincent's sister in law, was another key figure; most of the 128 Van Gogh works shown in Groningen came from her collection.

After the exhibition, on the advice of the “art tsar” H.P. Bremmer, influential Groningen professors including Gerard Heymans began collecting Van Gogh’s work. Lecturers at the Minerva Art Academy recognised his importance and transmitted it to the artists of De Ploeg. Van Gogh’s paintings provided seminal inspiration for their bright palette.

In short, the fin de siècle was a thrilling, decisive time in Groningen when a lot went on. How Van Gogh Came to Groningen is an unmissable show for anyone interested in the history of modern art.
