67,Forum Storyworld,2020,Wakawaka! 40 Years of PAC-MAN,"About the arcade legend PAC-MAN
One of the most iconic video game characters turned 40 in 2020 - PAC-MAN!

The famous yellow muncher was a game changer for gaming and is as popular as ever. Storyworld celebrated the anniversary of this arcade legend with a temporary exhibition in Otober, November and December 2020.

PAC-MAN truly was a game-changer in the world of arcade video games. Did you know that it was the very first game to utilize an iconic and recognizable character as a lead character? And that PAC-MAN tells a story through its gameplay and video interludes?

This revolutionary role extends into areas like video game marketing, and the expansion of the gaming audience to women and other demographics.

Game design, themes and colours
The exhibition explained the crucial role of the game design. Designer Toru Iwatani and his team deliberately looked at things women and other non-gaming demographics could want from a game (a lighthearted food theme, use of bright colours, easy difficulty settings at the start of the game), thus breaking every rule in the book such as use space themes, hard colours and make difficult games for 'true' gamers to sink their teeth in.

Pencil sketches, PAC-MAN posters and collector's items
Storyworld was the only European museum to have gained the approval and cooperation of Japanese video game company BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc. for the public display of objects. Our exhibition therefore included the first pencil sketches of PAC-MAN and the first Japanese PAC-MAN posters and adverts.

Arjan Terpstra, curator of the exhibition and co-author of the PAC-MAN anniversary book, has also sourced unique PAC-MAN collector’s items from the 80s and 90s from all over the world for the Groningen display. And of course original arcade gaming cabinets on which you could play the game!

About PAC-MAN
Born on May 22, 1980, PAC-MAN immediately rose to meteoric popularity, first in video game arcades, then on the pop culture stage and through an array of branding and entertainment appearances throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s. With a brand recognition rate of 90% around the world, PAC-MAN’s image and brand continues to be one of the most beloved and recognized on the planet.",2020.10-2020.12

3D animation, how do they do it?
During this temporary exhibition you had the change to discover how a 3D animation is made and a 3D world comes to life. What does it take, for example, to make eyes blink, legs move or have the wind blow through someone's hair? How do you create a complete jungle in the computer?

You could also find out how voices are recorded and how important the correct intonation is. And you could see the film's storyboard, which is one of the most important tools to decide how events will be visualised in the film.",2021.7-2021.8
70,Forum Storyworld,2021,Gerben Valkema: Cartoonist of the Year,"About the art of comic creation

In 2021, the Stripschapprijs, the most important award for Dutch comic creators, was awarded to Gerben Valkema (14 April 1980). That is why we are presented Gerben's work at Storyworld, the Dutch museum for comics, animation and games, from 4 September until 24 October 2021.

How it all started
Gerben was born and raised in Ulrum in the province of Groningen, and went on to study at the Art Academy in Groningen. He started his career as an illustrator at the studio of Dutch cartoonist Jan Kruis, where he illustrated and wrote for the Dutch comic strip Jan, Jans and de kinderen (Jack, Jacky and the Juniors). Gerben's ability to take on different drawing styles soon saw him doing illustrations for Suske en Wiske (Spike and Suzy/Willy and Wanda), Donald Duck and Disney.

Drawing style: bold, cool lines
Gerben's own drawing style is known for its bold, cool lines. He has a playful style of drawing, alternating thicker and thinner lines, which is also known as a 'comic-dynamic' style. Gerben likes to pay homage to other well-known cartoon characters by drawing them in his own style. You can still recognise the characters, of course, but they look completely different! This is more than just a funny trick – it also shows the impact of the illustrator's drawing style.

Elsje
Gerben wanted to create a comic of his own, too. This led to the creation of Elsje (Lizzy), which he developed together with writer Eric Hercules in 2007. Gerben likes crazy, exaggerated situations and he's a master at drawing facial expressions. This proved to be a winning combination: Elsje is published daily in seven Dutch newspapers, including Dagblad van het Noorden, and has been translated into English, German, Swedish, Norwegian, French, Danish, Spanish, Catalan, and the Dutch dialects of Gronings and Brabants.",2021.9-2021.10
71,Forum Storyworld,2021,Hans G. Kresse 100 Years,"Hans G. Kresse (December 3, 1921 - March 12, 1992) is still seen as one of the greatest comic book makers in the Netherlands, with an impressive talent for realistic drawing. That is why, for the celebration of his hundredth birthday, we will be putting Kresse's work in the spotlights at the comic, animation and game museum Storyworld and at GRID Graphic Museum Groningen.",2021.11-2021.12
72,Forum Storyworld,2021,The World of Lara Croft,"25 years of Tomb Raider

Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft’s first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we put The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to May 29, 2022. 

Crafting a Croft
Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene. 

As the game was about ‘raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,’ the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.

Success and controversy
Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games’ leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.

Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld
This exhibition explored the successful franchise in-depth. It looked at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dived into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.

After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.",2021.12-2022.5
73,Forum Storyworld,2022,Donald Duck,"The happiest weekly magazine for 70 years long

World-famous, extremely popular and created exactly 70 years ago this year: the weekly Donald Duck magazine. In this exhibition, you can discover how a Donald Duck story is created, how the illustrations are made and how the entire comic comes to life in the Storyworld Spotlight: Donald Duck, the happiest weekly magazine for 70 years long. This Spotlight is open from 3 June to 30 October 2022.
The birth of the weekly Donald Duck magazine
The weekly Donald Duck magazine is still the Netherlands’ most popular comic. That’s quite an achievement, as there is so much competition. This situation used to be very different. In the early 1950s, there were hardly any children’s magazines. Comics and other kinds of magazines were considered to be dangerous, and have a bad influence on children. Fortunately, De Geïllustreerde Pers, a large Dutch publisher, ignored that sentiment and launched the Donald Duck comic on 25 October 1952. The first issue was distributed free of charge in a print run of no less than 2.5 million copies! This marked the beginning of our beloved duck’s great success story.

A Donald Duck story
Every single day, writers in the Netherlands and across the world are busy thinking up new Duck stories. These stories are then converted into scenarios. When designing a scenario, the writer makes important decisions. How many images should appear on a page? What happens in each image? Should Donald feature close up or from far away? Throughout this process, the writer needs to put himself or herself in Donald Duck’s shoes (remembering that he has flat feet!). In practice, that isn’t easy.

The creative process behind a Donald Duck illustration
Once the writer has thought up the whole story, an artist converts the scenario into a series of beautiful illustrations. And then one last, but important thing is missing: colour! When creating a Donald Duck story, a lot of careful thought is put into colour. Donald's beak is orange, but did you know that there are over 100 shades of orange alone? The colourist always tries to identify the best colour combinations so that the comic comes into its own. 

Meet the illustrators behind Donald Duck
Discover the work and background of various Donald Duck illustrators in the Storyworld Spotlight: Donald Duck - the funniest weekly magazine for 70 years long. The exhibition features Michel Nadorp, Henrieke Goorhuis, Tim Artz and many other Donald Duck illustrators.",2022.6-2022.10

76,Forum Storyworld,2023,The Legend of Zelda,"From November 4, 2023 through February 25, 2024, Storyworld turns the spotlight on The Legend of Zelda, the Nintendo game series that has been immensely popular since the 1980s. To this day, millions of gamers immerse themselves in the fascinating world of the heroic swordsman Link, the great villain Ganon and, of course, Princess Zelda. In the museum's Spotlight Room, discover the story behind the Zelda games and see how one Japanese boy's outdoor adventures transformed into one of the world's most influential games.

A true legend in the gaming world
On Feb. 21, 1986, The Legend of Zelda was released in Japan on Nintendo's Famicom (Family Computer). Zelda grew out of the ideas, experiences and fantasies of Shigeru Miyamoto, who is considered the spiritual father of the series. Almost every Zelda game innovated in one way or another. The first game (1986) proved that great open world games were possible, and later Ocarina of Time (1998) became a forerunner in 3D gaming. Consequently, many gamers consider the Zelda games to be the best game series to date.

Zelda, Link, Ganon, Gorons and Zoras
The Zelda games revolve around the young hero Link (the playable character), Princess Zelda and Ganon(dorf), the king of the Gerudo and a pig-like monster. With Link, the player explores the world, solves puzzles in large dungeons and collects more and more equipment to eventually save the princess and defeat Ganon. Most of the games in the series are set in and around the kingdom of Hyrule, a fantasy world inspired by the Western European Middle Ages. Hyrule is filled with elf-like Hylians, Gorons rolling around in the mountains and Zoras, water creatures swimming through the lakes.

Storyworld Spotlight: The Legend of Zelda
In the Spotlight exhibit, discover more about the origins and development of the game: from The Legend of Zelda (1986) to the recent Tears of the Kingdom (2023). You can also admire artwork from the series over the past three decades: from images from the first, pixelated volumes to wall-sized illustrations created for most recent games. You will also see interviews with the creators and replicas of weapons and other items from the games. To complement the exhibition, public activities include a Zelda sword 3D printing workshop and a lecture by Willem Hilhorst of Beeld & Geluid on the special link between Zelda and the Netherlands.

Storyworld can be found on the sixth floor of Forum Groningen. A ticket to Storyworld gives free admission to the mini-exhibition in the Spotlight area.",2023.11-2024.2
77,Forum Storyworld,2024,50 Years of Franka,"Franka is one of the most popular Dutch comics. She also enjoys great international acclaim. Her stories have now been translated into French, German, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Galician, Catalan and Chinese. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the red-haired and enterprising protagonist's first adventure. To celebrate, from March 2 through June 30, 2024, the Spotlight Room at Museum Storyworld will be dedicated to this iconic comic book hero.

Storyworld Spotlight: 50 years of Franka
The Spotlight exhibition shows how this iconic Dutch comic has evolved over the years. In addition to hand inked comic pages and pencil sketches by Henk Kuijpers, you will see how this creator goes about his work. For Franka, he does extensive research and often personally visits the locations in the stories to take pictures and drawings. As a visitor to the exhibition, you can also work on making yourself aware of this process.

From supporting role to leading role 
In 1974 Henk Kuipers (Haarlem, 1946) made a short comic strip for the then immensely popular comic magazine Pep. Men play the leading roles in the strip, but somewhere in a corner of the first page a special script girl is depicted; a girl who sees to it that the film script is followed precisely. The editors of Pep are enthusiastic, and Kuijpers is hired to produce short stories and illustrations. Soon Franka gets the lead role and grows into the first independent female comic book hero of Dutch soil. Franka is smart, savvy, self-aware, independent and headstrong. Eventually, the scriptgirl earns her own business together as an art detective and travels the world.

Storyworld Spotlight: 50 Years of Franka can be visited from March 2 through June 30, 2024 at comic book, animation and game museum Storyworld in Forum Groningen",2024.3-2024.6
