82,Noorderlicht,2019,Rahi Rezvani,"The Iranian visual artist Rahi Rezvani (1978) doesn’t exhibit often. It is therefore very special that from 16th January, we are able to present a solo exhibition of him in our gallery, featuring a number of firsts: images that have never been seen on the wall before.
Rezvani is a gifted storyteller who speaks in powerful images. He works without compromise, authenticity is far more important to him than popularity. In his photographic work, Rezvani is always looking for a chemical reaction between him and the shutter. A way to put soul into his images. Stemming from his background as a fine art painter, he says he uses the camera as a sort of airbrush. Craftsmanship is an explicit part of his work: lighting and technical expertise bring him to his magical compositions, printed on heavy, matte photography paper. “I don’t believe in photography without print”, Rezvani states.

Rezvani combines his talents as a filmmaker and photographer in long-term collaborations with artists, collectives and companies in the realms of music, theatre and fashion. In addition to his pioneering work for the Nederlands Dans Theater, for which Rezvani has been producing all the photographs, campaigns, films and books since 2006, Noorderlicht | House of Photography is mainly showing his work for the music industry. Just as Corbijn is inexplicably linked to U2, Rezvani is linked to the Editors. After photographing the British band at the Tivoli temple of pop in Utrecht in 2014, he was given free rein with regards to all their photography, video clips and artwork. Rezvani’s design for the Editors’ album Violence was nominated for the Art Vinyl Awards 2018 in the category ‘best album cover’. We are also showing the short music video Prehension, made for the Dutch composer and pianist Joep Beving. Plus, you can see shoots that Rezvani has made for Wende, Anohni and Halina Reijn, among others.",2019.1-2019.3

IN VIVO tempo","IN VIVO tempo is a poetic reflection on the relation between nature and culture. For this occasion, Noorderlicht | House of Photography is transformed into a film house, full of chillout rooms and cinema spaces. IN VIVO tempo features the work of five cross-media artists who use the moving image to make the viewer aware of the fragile relationship between man and our seemingly natural environment. The works have a meditative character with immersive soundtracks that allow the viewer to be transported. IN VIVO tempo is a continuation on the theme of the earlier IN VIVO photography event, curated by head curator Wim Melis.

ANNE SENSTAD (NORWAY, 1967)
A triptych of videos with visuals by Senstad and music by JG Thirlwell, about the interaction between man, nature and cultural history. The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2015. JG Thirlwell is a legendary musician who is also known under the aliases Foetus, Steroid Maximus and Manorexia.

The Swamp
A lyrical homage to the American South, where the swamp is the bearer of many tales. They are valuable, transitional ecosystems harbouring life and death, beauty and darkness, refuge and hunting. Swamps keep us alive: they play an important role in stabilising the water balance and they represent a place of freedom for former slaves and other displaced groups.

The Sugarcane Labyrinth
A portrait of the creation of agricultural land art on 5600 m2 of land in Louisiana. The labyrinth of sugarcane symbolises many cultural-political developments, such as traditional agriculture versus large-scale industry, sustainability versus shrinkage, but also community spirit, new energy and traditional sugar production. The video conveys the experience of wandering searchingly through an overwhelming environment, interlaced with philosophical and spiritual texts about the labyrinth of the mind.

HELEN SEAR (GREAT BRITAIN, 1955)
Sear explores the crossover between photography and art and has been focusing on the coexistence of man and nature in her work since the 1980s. Her work moves between photography, sculpture, sound and video and wishes to make optimal use of the artistic experience as a means of evoking involvement and activating people.

Wahaha Biota
The film follows the daily forest management from tree planting to their processing in the sawmill. The forest as a raw material and the forest as an environment come together in a video in which work and play intertwine. In the soundtrack, human voices are used as instruments, in harmony with the sounds of nature. The work is a lyrical study of man and forest, the conclusion of a year-long residency in Dalby Forest. (Biota: the flora and fauna of a specific area or period.)

CHRISTINA SEELY (UNITED STATES, 1976)
Seely sets out on an expedition to investigate the relationship between man, time and planet. She takes both natural and artificial systems as her subject. The conflict between superficial documentation and underlying complexity is integral to the work. Noorderlicht has previously shown her series on light pollution in the photography festival Metropolis.

Terra Systema Tempo
This work consists of two contrasting images which together represent the cycle of the planet. Respiro is about the rainforest as a living, breathing system; she created it while staying at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Station in Panama. Flumen looks at the melting ice in Greenland, where Seely participated in two scientific expeditions. The ice water is shown in ever-increasing intensity, beginning with small streams and building up to enormous forces upon reaching the ocean. Her installation is a moving dialogue between the two ecological extremes at either end of Western life.

***************

CHRIS JORDAN (UNITED STATES, 1963)
Chris Jordan has evoked huge response with his photography series Midway, in which he showed how plastic filled the stomachs of thousands of deceased young Albatrosses. Jordan is a multimedia artist and activist; he wants to make the subconscious of our mass culture tangible. The Midway photographs have been shown by Noorderlicht in the Nature Museum Fryslan.

Albatross
The 90-minute film Albatross is a sequel to the photography series. The film starts off as a loving nature documentary, telling about the beauty of the Albatross and its extraordinary life in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, on the Midway atoll thousands of kilometres away from civilisation. But the film soon turns into horror as it shows parents feeding their children streams of coloured plastic, the ground littered with dead chicks.

The film is set up as a meditation to be experienced from start to finish, and is therefore shown once a day, at 2 pm.

EVAN ROTH (UNITED STATES, 1975)
The internet is Evan Roth’s raw material. Based on a hacker philosophy, he depicts transient moments in contemporary popular culture. In doing so, he uses various media, including video. One of his achievements: he succeeded in getting to the top of Google’s rankings with the search query ‘bad ass mother fucker’.

Red Lines
Under our feet and all around us is an invisible, constantly mutating current. Roth searched for the physical anchor points: the coastal locations where underground internet cables come ashore. He made films of the landscape at these specific locations, shot in the same infrared that shines through the optical cables. In the artwork, he streams the videos to the audience from servers operating at the locations concerned. The soundtrack is created by scanning radio signals on the spot using ghost hunter equipment and combining them with sounds from the surrounding nature itself. The work bears witness to a paradoxical silence between two worlds.",2019.4-2019.5
84,Noorderlicht,2019,"Philippe Dudouit
The Dynamics of Dust","In THE DYNAMICS OF DUST Philippe Dudouit documents the new relationships that the various indigenous, historically nomadic inhabitants of the Sahel-Saharan belt have forged with a territory they cannot pass through freely – or safely – anymore. The region, a former tourist paradise, is now officially off-limits to foreigners due to a burgeoning abduction industry. This has made the already dire economic situation even worse, cutting off large parts of the population from an income essential to their subsistence.

At first glance, the rise of Islamic terrorism in this area is to blame, but a closer look reveals a reality that is much more complex. The area now faces a dangerous cocktail of underdevelopment, poverty and state failure. The new, transnational constellation of powers consists of armed islamists, human traffickers, drugs and weapon smugglers, topped off by international interests jockeying to win oil, gold and uranium mining rights. The lack of political vision for the area’s future, in combination with ongoing desertification due to climate change make up for a scenario in which a doomed generation is growing up.

Dudouit’s work is based on in-depth historic, geopolitical and cartographic documentation, research and analysis. As such, THE DYNAMICS OF DUST (2008-2018) constitutes a long-term photographic study on the socio-political evolution of the Sahelo-Saharan zone.",2019.6-2019.8
85,Noorderlicht,2019,Martiniplaza | Noorderlicht 30 jaar,"On the occasion of the 30th anniversary Noorderlicht, we present a cross section of the photography that we presented over the last three decades. In MartiniPlaza we show work by photographers from all corners of the globe, whose work is connected to each other by the mission of Noorderlicht: to bring the audience in touch with imaginative, socially relevant art.
In 1990, a group of passionate photo enthusiasts decided to organize a photo party in Groningen to celebrate the tenth anniversary of what was then still called the USVA Photo Gallery. That party grew into the first Noorderlicht festival. In the years that followed, Noorderlicht developed into a professional, internationally acclaimed photo institution, with the whole of the Northern Netherlands as its primary field of activity and a wide range of activities.",2019.9-2019.12

Thus, a multifaceted and autonomous artistic image of scientific life will be created over the years. The assignment for 2018 was given to Eddo Hartmann. His series ‘The Collective Landscape’ is now exhibited in the Natuurmuseum Fryslân in Leeuwarden (NL).

50 Years Lauwersmeer | photo walking tour","Background
After the flood of 1953, the safety of the Dutch coastal areas was re-examined. The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) was faced with the choice of raising the dikes around the Lauwerszee or closing off the estuary. The latter was chosen under pressure from the Frisian population. The people of Groningen were less happy with the closure at the time, because this forced the shrimp fleet of Zoutkamp to move to the new port of Lauwersoog.

On May 23, 1969, Queen Juliana supervised how the last caissons were sunk and secured. Two days later, the Lauwers Sea had officially become a lake. After the closure, the high-lying seabeds (which previously belonged to the Wadden) became dry. In the early years, large parts of this were virtually left to their own devices, so that much nature was created.

Walking route Lauwersmeer: ​​until August 16, 2020
The walking route starts at Parking Strandweg, click here (in Dutch) for directions. The presentation along a walking route was originally shown until May 23, 2020, the day on which the Lauwersmeer exists exactly 51 years, but has been extended until the end of the summer holidays.",2019.10-2020.8
88,Noorderlicht,2019,"Ton Broekhuis
Terzijde","Ton Broekhuis photographs beauty, bloom and mortality in his immediate surroundings in the Frisian area of Stellingwerven. With his dog as loyal walking companion, he moves through the landscape and crawls deep into his own garden. From blades of grass to woods to the little corpses of birds, time after time there is the surprising richness of a seemingly unsightly nature. Thus, sharing his lyrical gaze with the viewer, the gaze of someone who sees what others do not. In his work intimacy and abstraction alternate, in grand journeys through a world within walking distance.

A long oeuvre precedes this most recent work by the landscape photographer of the North. For 30 years, Broekhuis has cherished the northern landscape’s vastness, the freedom of emptiness. His work deals with the feeling the land evokes, any trueness to nature is subordinate to this. The process of interpretation and experimentation – once in the dark room, now in front of a screen – is where the work really comes to life.

Also on show in the exhibition is a cross-section from his earlier photographs and the many books he has published. At the start of his career he worked for the magazineNieuwe Revu, among others, and photographed socially engaged subjects, later the landscape became central in his work. His aesthetic language is already discernible in the early work about the meat industry and continues in his first projects on landscape and architecture. With ‘Een wijde blik verruimt het denken’(A wide view expands thinking), commissioned by the GADO bus company, he establishes his reputation.",2019.1-2019.11

TEMPS ZERO","Since 2012, the international collective Temps Zero – led by photographer and curator Stéphane Charpentier and sound artist Alyssa Moxley – has been bringing together a new generation of international experimental visual and sound artists. The group travels across European cities in ever-changing line-ups, with poetic exhibitions, improvised concerts and workshop presentations. 

 

This collectively supported art project is like a close-knit family of outsiders, looking for their place in an unruly world. The participants find each other in their existential drive for freedom and the intensely creative impulses that result from it. Together they fuse photography, video, sound art and music into penetrating sensory experiences. 

 

From January 16 to April 12, 2020, Temps Zero settles in Groningen and presents an interactive installation in the Noorderlicht studio. In the halls, images are combined with multi-track sound that responds via sensors to the movements of visitors. A continuous projection is shown in a film room with a specially composed score.

90,Noorderlicht,2020,Noorderlicht International Photo Festival 2020: Generation Z,"GENERATION Z, the 27th edition of the Noorderlicht International Photo Festival, is about the youngest generation of world citizens, born after 1995. What is their place in society, how do they see their future, what are their ambitions? By tapping into the hopes and fears of Generation Z, Noorderlicht aims to provide insight into their young adult world. A sharp selection has been made for the festival, that shows a generation focusing on fundamental emancipation processes.
Generation Z is the first group of digital world citizens to have an infinite amount of information at their fingertips from an early age on. But they are also naturally aware of its problematic relationship with the truth. Generation Z is witnessing the start of the fourth industrial revolution, in which technology is turning labour relations and the very essence of humanity upside down. Z is confronted with climate threats and an exhausted earth. It has no conscious memories of 9/11 or of a time without war on terror. It grows up in a world where it sees itself surrounded by work pressure problems, economic stagnation and nationalistic sentiment. They are young adults with less expectations of a stable future than their parents, something they hold previous generations responsible for.

New balance
If one thing is clear to this generation it’s this: the current system no longer suffices. They collectively take to the streets to bring about change and fight hand in hand for a new balance between the forces that must guarantee the future of this planet. Z is clearing up radically, speeding up things like equality and inclusiveness. Subjects such as de-colonialisation, gender equality and body positivity are high on the agenda, and that is just the beginning. Generation Z is about realising a turning point, creating a basis for a new future and taking responsibility. In this story it is the personification of a change in thinking and acting, in which all generations will have to participate.

Guest curator: Robert Jan Verhagen
Robert Jan Verhagen was active as initiator / artistic director in The Hague at successively 1646, <> TAG and LhGWR. Verhagen loves customization, which shows from the special way in which he has been engaged in talent development over the past decade. The sustainable trajectories that he undertook with diverse photographic talent have resulted in wonderful and successful careers. His eye for young makers was the main motivation to ask Verhagen for this edition of Noorderlicht Festival.",2020.7-2020.9

Aside","Ton Broekhuis photographs beauty, bloom and death in his immediate surroundings in the Frisian area of Stellingwerven. He walks through the landscape and crawls deep into his own garden. From blades of grass and woods to flower buds and bird corpses, time and again encountering the surprising richness of a seemingly unsightly nature. In his work intimacy and abstraction alternate, in grand journeys through a world within walking distance.
Since the eighties, Ton Broekhuis (1951) is a passionate photographer, who also devoted himself fully to the development of socially engaged photography in the Northern Netherlands. This path led to the founding of the Noorderlicht Photo Festival in 1990, of which he became director. In the years that followed, Noorderlicht developed into a dynamic and idiosyncratic institution, earning international respect. After his retirement, Broekhuis picked up his camera anew.

In 2018, Noorderlicht presented this exhibition in her Studio in Groningen. De Volkskrant awarded five stars. “The mortality of things sets the theme of his photographs, in which he isolates plants that have ceased blossoming, dried-up seed chambers and dandelion clocks from their surroundings by placing them in front of a black background. These little mortals bathe in a soft autumn light, crying out in all their insignificance for an attentive eye.”",2020.10-2020.12

What if | the future of the northern landscape","Since Tuesday, March 9th, we started to welcome visitors again, according to the guidelines of the government and RIVM. If you want to visit the exhibition, you must purchase an online (free) ticket at least four hours prior to your visit. We can allow two visitors per half hour, wearing a mouth mask is mandatory, as is the 1.5 meter distance rule.

At the beginning of this year, SIGN and Noorderlicht launched the research project ‘What If’ out of a shared interest in the development of the northern landscape. Artists Linde Ex and Aebele Trijsburg have spent the past few months dealing with the question: what will the future northern landscape look like? Initially they started the research process together. Along the way, Linde and Aebele veered into two independent directions, the results of which are presented together.
Linde Ex assumes a future scenario in which the dikes disappear, and people start living with the tides. She is particularly interested in shifting the perspective: what if we take the measure of benthic life – small creatures living on the seabed – as just as self-evident as the human measure? For example, Linde made scale models of a radial mound – based on historical research – and placed them on the tide line in four locations along the coast of Friesland and Groningen. Once there, seabed life, silt and seawater influence the models, whereby the design of the landscape is magnified by the sea. The observations of the models, influenced by the mud flats, form the starting point for the creation of a futuristic scenario and new work for the final presentation.

Aebele Trijsburg focuses on the human factor in the formation of the landscape. According to him, the fight against water is illustrative for the myths that the Netherlands was created by us, that we control the water and that, without our interventions, the country would be half-drowned. Aebele believes that this image needs to be reformed. The cause of rising sea levels lies primarily with human beings themselves, who have turned the land into a kind of bathtub by way of cultivation. In order to invest in smart solutions in the long term, we need to change our thinking, for example by allowing the Netherlands’ soil to grow with the water level and by strengthening natural barriers. With his work for ‘What If’, Aebele hopes to make people aware of the need for this cultural change.

Linde Ex
Linde Ex (Nijmegen, 1983) is interested in the traces of non-human worlds that are often ignored or overlooked. She works from a broad research perspective and enjoys collaborating with artists from other disciplines as well as scientists, which encourages her to look at things from different angles. This way, she produced videos, installations, drawings and books. Material research is also an important way of approaching a subject in her work. Linde Ex graduated from the Frank Mohr Institute in Groningen in 2018, with the master’s degree MADtech.

Aebele Trijsburg
In the view of Aebele Trijsburg (Barchem, 1991), a constant search for meaning is an essential ingredient for understanding ideas such as truth and goodness. This process produces work that is both narrative and strange at the same time. The narrative character encourages interpretation, the surrealistic side blocks the route to clarity. Aebele Trijsburg creates paintings, objects, sculptures and photographs. He graduated from the Minerva Art Academy in Groningen in 2013.

The Stones in pictures","From 14 November to 11 April, Noorderlicht and the Stichting Oude Groninger Kerken present a large exhibition on The Rolling Stones in the Der Aa-kerk. ‘GIMME SHELTER’ shows work by photographers as well as documentaries, television material and much more. The exhibition runs parallel to ‘Unzipped’ in the Groninger Museum and offers a different view of the legendary band, by presenting a lot of early photography and partly approaching The Stones from a Dutch-Groningen perspective.
PHOTOGRAPHY
Bent Rej (Denmark, 1940-2016), was part of The Rolling Stones entourage during the Satisfaction tour from March 1965 to May 1966. He became a confidant and friend of the band, who gave him carte blanche. Former Stones bassist Bill Wyman calls Rej’s work “the finest single collection of Stones photographs I’ve ever seen”. From the same time: the infamous Stones concert in the Kurhaus in The Hague, which got completely out of hand. Rob Bosboom (Netherlands, 1940-2017) accompanied The Rolling Stones that day. He was one of the country’s first real pop photographers. During the seventies Gijsbert Hanekroot (Netherlands, 1945) was the lead photographer of the music magazine OOR. In this period his beautiful Stones archive arose, of which a selection will be shown during ‘GIMME SHELTER’. Hanekroot captures their huge presence on stage as well as intimate moments behind the scenes. Claude Vanheye (Netherlands, 1948) was the youngest and most successful Dutch photographer in the 1970s and a leading figure in the international pop scene. All the world stars appeared in front of his lens. In his Stones-work he shows the persons behind the music in shoots done backstage and in the studio.

FILM
Groningen local Nick Landman messaged all his friends asking: Where were you on 2nd June 1999? Most of them still knew: in the Stadspark at The Rolling Stones concert. Landman made a documentary about it (trailer). We also show unknown fragments from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, Boudewijn Büch’s interview with Mick Jagger from 1997, the documentary ‘I Am a Rolling Stone’ (Roeland Dijksterhuis, 2020) and a reconstruction of the Kurhaus concert for the Andere Tijden TV show.

MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR, part 1: residency","When public life first came to a standstill due to the corona pandemic, Sarah Carlier (1981) saw numerous creative initiatives spring up. “For the first time, I saw Joseph Beuys’ claim that everyone is essentially an artist actually become reality,” she says. She christened her regular walking route through the Haagse Bos, The Hague Organic Open Air Folk Museum (HOOVM) and observed the emergence and transformation of various sculptures made of branches, moss and bark. As soon as the measures were relaxed, the playful persons also disappeared. However, in Carlier, something had awakened.

MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR
In Groningen, Carlier will investigate how she can preserve the playfulness of the unintentional art she found in the forest within her own work and pass it on to others. The project’s title is an ode to the African American folk artist Mose Tolliver, a great source of inspiration to Carlier. She first became familiar with his work whilst travelling through the United States, and was attracted by its sincerity and rough, colourful and humorous imagery. Folk artists such as Tolliver have taught Carlier to utilise her intuition again, which, she says, had become side-lined over the years through her professionalization as a visual artist. This playful, unforced manner of making, which every person carries within them, forms the guiding principle for Carlier’s residency at Noorderlicht.

Meet Sarah!
In the studio, where a retrospective exhibition of her oeuvre is also on view, Carlier talks with visitors, students and pupils about what art can mean. And when she is not working in the studio, she visits Groningen initiatives and private museums or has conversations in the street, always in search of artistic creations by residents and local companies. A song, poem, painting, photo, installation, knitting or dance – Carlier is interested in everything that comes from an intrinsic need to create. The entire research, the conversations and the local art creations found by the people of Groningen will lead to new works by the artist himself. In the course of Carlier’s stay, all elements are woven into a playful, hybrid web that is constantly growing and changing. ‘MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR’ is an investigation into the role of play, creativity and art in everyday life.",##
95,Noorderlicht,2021,Noorderlicht Bloom Unhinged,"Last year, we started the Noorderlicht Young-project, aiming to connect to a group of passionate and
creative young people, engaged in lens-based media. Noorderlicht asked one of the participants of 2020, Alex Murphy, to bring the project to the next level. As a curator, he gathered an international and eclectic group of artists and designers for the 2021 edition, who call themselves Noorderlicht BLOOM. During the Noorderlicht Festival they present the project‘Unhinged' at various locations in the centre of Groningen.

In the exhibition, the group members reflect on how their perception of reality has changed since the start of the pandemic. Physical doors have been closed for them, but on the flip side, mental doors have been opened as a result. Using this framework, Noorderlicht BLOOM presents ‘Unhinged', a multimedia exhibition consisting of 11

landscape by its striking steel-blue colour. This pumping station can discharge 460 cubic meters per minute of water from the polder into the sea. Usually if you stand here for a while, you can just hear the pumping station kick in, which switches on automatically if necessary. During the
Noorderlicht exhibition, however, the drainage is done manually. The automation is perfect for the function of safety and water management, but it also has a major
drawback. Just like dikes and locks, pumping stations are a major obstacle for migratory fish, because they must be able to migrate between fresh and salt water to survive.
That is why in 2001Ropta was equipped with a fish passage. In the spring and autumn, it is therefore very busy in the fishing area. Migratory fish such as smelt, three-spined stickleback and eel make use of the fish migration system in that period.

97,Noorderlicht,2021,Pumping Station de Heining,"Pumping station de Heining, remarkably enough built ín the dike, is part of the water management of Friesland. The pumping station comes into operation when the water level in the Frisian bosom, the interconnected system of canals and lakes, is too high. The augers can then pump 250 cubic meters of water per minute to the sea and thus form a useful addition to the IJsselmeer pumping stations. De Heining,commissioned in 2018 by Wetterskip Fryslan, is part of a larger plan, of a new way of thinking about water management, an internal ‘climate change' you could say. Moving more along with nature and the water instead of fighting against it. That is quite exciting, because we have built dikes for a thousand years to protect ourselves against the violence of the sea. This pumping station is the ideal environment for the meditative underwater world of artist and filmmaker Ewa Doroszenko.",2021.9-2021.10

On Monday September 27,the Netherlands Film Festival, in collaboration with Noorderlicht, is
organizing an online panel from Stadsschouwburg Utrecht about the increasing use of AR filters and other digital technologies and their influence on our identity and self-image. Curators Daniela Tenenbaum& Niv Fux will discuss this with three prominent artists who explore the use of AR filters and digital
technologies to challenge our boundaries of being: Ines Alpha, Andy Picci and Marcela Baltarete.The artists present their work and share their insights in a discussion with the public.
“When you look at yourself in the mirror, does your image exist? Is that you or someone else? Do you exist only as yourself or, quite the opposite, do you have more than one existence?”
These questions posed by Jean-Luc Godard in 1977 seem today more relevant than ever. They render some of the long-debated intricacies that lie in the gap between image and representation, what is real and what is not, and, in particular, the relationship between the self-image and the way our image is perceived by others. Today, these issues are becoming further entangled through the ubiquitous presence of the digital image and the growing use of AR filters on social media.
As our dependency on digital interactions increases and our physical identity becomes almost overshadowed by the virtual one, we recognise great importance in critically looking at the societal,
cultural and political implications arising from our reshaping digital self-image.
The wide use of AR filters, Snapchat Lenses, and 3D modeling, prompt an array of questions on self-representation, visual culture and current and future realities - what kind of new opportunities are introduced by these technologies, and what are the so-called risks? How would the way we perceive ourselves and others be transformed through this? And how would these technologies alter the future image?",2021.9

MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR, part 2: exhibition","Until Sunday 13 March (extended), Flemish artist Sarah Carlier (1981) exhibits in Noorderlicht Studio with the exhibition ‘MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR’ . In her photographs and video installations she explores the role of art in everyday life. What makes something art? And what does society gain from it?
In the spring of 2021, Carlier was the first artist in residence in the Noorderlicht Studio. Using it as a base, she turned the city into her studio; collecting objects and stories, making interventions in the public space, approaching Groningers who are creatively active themselves and asking them to lend her their work. Carlier’s criterion was that these works of art were ‘made from an intrinsic need to create, and not from a desire to be an artist’.

This flexible attitude inherent in creativity – breaking free from one’s own conceptions, being able to see everyday things in a new light – is precisely what Carlier’s artistic practice is about. All her ‘studies’, art finds, and new work inspired by this will be brought together in a playful mix in ‘MUDDY PINK DINOSAUR’. Carlier challenges the viewer to look differently at their immediate surroundings, at the world and at art.",2021.11-2022.3

Performing Adulthood","What does growing up mean for Generation Z, and how do young people portray themselves? Performing Adulthood is a photography and video project by Robin Alysha Clemens about young people between the ages of 16 and 24. They are in a stage that revolves around forming their own identity and dealing with more responsibilities and independence. Part of the commission cycle Imagining Science, a collaboration with the State University of Groningen, in which different research fields serve as inspiration for an autonomous art project. Robin Alysha Clemens is the fourth photographer that was given such a commission.
Performing Adulthood is about looking and being seen, about hiding and revealing. About presenting yourself, and how this sometimes fails. 

This project provides a glimpse into the world of generation Z. It prompts us to think about the self-image of young people, for whom the presence of cameras has become a matter of course. Performing Adulthood shows the abrasive, inquisitive and sometimes uncomfortable moments that shape our perception of adulthood, representation and identity.

In Performing Adulthood, Robin Alysha Clemens reverses the roles of photographer and model. She invited young people to portray themselves in the studio, and then allowed the model-photographers to select and curate their own photos. The project, however, not only shows the end product of this ‘performance’, but also the process that precedes it. The visitor of the exhibition therefore also becomes an observer of the moments that are not posed, moments when the performance fails and a photograph ends up in the trash can.

In addition to these self-portraits, there are six scenes in which different groups of friends talk to each other about subjects such as online dating, friendship, death, climate change, loneliness, careers, housing shortage and social media. By observing these interactions, an intimate image is created of how these young people present themselves. Not just to a spectator in a gallery or a photographer with a camera, but particularly to each other.

In a world where visual representations are more important than ever, Performing Adulthood poses the question: what do we show and what would we rather keep hidden? How do others see us and how much control do we actually have over it?

This project arose from a collaboration with the University of Groningen and Noorderlicht. In the series ‘Imagining Science’, a photographer is commissioned each year to depict a field of scientific research in relation to a Noorderlicht theme. This edition’s theme was Generation Z.

Out of the Bog","‘Out of the Bog’ is Baukje Venema’s photographic collaboration with Noorderlicht and the daily newspaper Dagblad van het Noorden. It follows a slow journalism project about poverty in the ‘Veenkolonial’ areas, where historically peet was dug from the ground, about the causes of poverty as often transferred from generation to generation. The project features portraits of current residents, collages that are based on images from historical archives and texts from the journalistic project.
When you are seemingly stuck on paths that have been trodden for generations, how do you set out on a new path?

The former peat colonies of Groningen and Drenthe were originally boglands where pioneers cut peat, waterways brought wealth, and agriculture and industry reinforced each other. Until the modern age turned its back. Nowadays, the area is associated with deprivation. At the same time, residents are proud of their region, and fed up with its image.

How does change come about when your region’s history and image are tied to sod huts and peat labourers, when its story and ensuing consequences are woven into the fabric of your family?

That is the key question for photographer Baukje Venema within this exhibition. It also provided the starting point for the same-named journalistic project by Maaike Borst (Dagblad van het Noorden), which tells the stories of the five families shown here from the peat colonies. Venema drew inspiration from this and created a series of photographs and videos corresponding to the timelines of the written project.

Old archive images, stories and paintings from the region form the basis of this visual investigation into change and transformation over time. Venema opted for experimental series in which she works with photographs, video and paint. By abstracting, blurring or inverting images, the viewer experiences new perspectives.

She photographed the current residents using a nineteenth-century glass plate camera. They seem to look back on an eventful past. Simultaneously, they form new benchmarks on an infinite timeline: where do you come from, where are you, where are you going?

Out of the bog is a collaboration between the Noorderlicht Photography Foundation and Dagblad van het Noorden.

The Financial Zone","The Financial Zone is a visual investigation into the financial world and its corporate culture. Nick Hannes focusses on situations behind the scenes of a number of financial institutions in the Netherlands and Belgium. He created the photo series as an autonomous commission, given by the State University of Groningen and Noorderlicht.
When the media report on economics, they usually show images of workers  or operational personnel somewhere in the production chain. If white collar employees are depicted at all, it’s mostly though stereotypical stock photography. Men and women in suits, smiling wide and shaking hands, represent the dynamic character and diversity that the company wants to radiate. We rarely see them in real action.

Photographer Nick Hannes (Belgium, 1974) went to the head offices of a number of banks and financial companies in The Netherlands and Belgium to depict office life in a documentary manner, with office employees, those in charge and the echelon in-between playing the lead.

Modular systems and clean desk policy are their environment. The new workplace is social and flexible, fashionable and homely, ergonomic and technological. Company restaurants offer healthy meals and corporate mindfulness is on the rise. There is fitness, a prayer room and art on the wall. Well-being in the workplace is important in a time characterised by stress and burn-outs.

Hannes’s photographs are subtle observations of an astonished outsider. In a universe not exactly known for visual spectacle, he focusses on the relationship between man and his workplace. He searches for personal accents in a generic environment, meandering along the thin dividing line between banality and surprise, between humour and alienation.

This photo series was commissioned by the University of Groningen and Noorderlicht as part of the cycle Imagining Science. Hannes has been in dialogue with several researchers at the university. The cycle is founded on the idea that science and art have much in common: an urge to explore the world around us and to make acquired knowledge tangible, to share it. These commissions are inspired by university research whose subject is in keeping with the Noorderlicht themes. In the long term, this captures a multifaceted picture of scientific life.",2022.4-2022.7

In the Courtroom with Rocks","The recently in Groningen graduated artists Marina Sulima (Moldavië) and Olivia d’Cruz (India) present a mixed media exhibition about the earthquakes in the province of Groningen, caused by the extraction of natural gas. They draw parallels to problematic mining areas elsewhere in the world, in Indonesia and India. This exhibition is part of a long-running collaboration with the PBD Culture Fund, about the moving Groninger soil.
The Enlightenment taught us that the Earth is a passive ball of resources spinning endlessly across the galaxy. Following this epiphany came decades of rampant extraction, washing of sensitive ecosystems with petrochemicals, altering the soil, waters and atmosphere. There’s now enough evidence to suggest that the Earth is not just a static background indifferent to human actions, but rather that it is sensitive and is able to react to its abuse.

In The Courtroom with Rocks examines three locations in which the geological layer of the earth responds to resource extraction; drilling induced earthquakes in the province of Groningen, The Netherlands, a blowout of a natural gas well triggering the eruption of a mud volcano in Sidoarjo, Indonesia and a hybrid ecosystem at an abandoned iron ore mine in Goa, India.

By borrowing the structure of a court case, various films, animations and installations convene to visually investigate some of the complexities around mining and their implications on different landscapes and their inhabitants.

This project is part of Renewed Energy, a multi-year project cooperation between BPD Cultuurfonds and Noorderlicht.",##
107,Noorderlicht,2022,"Ukraine: The Path to Freedom
27 Ukrainian artists","This exhibition presents the wealth of Ukrainian photography throughout five decades. It begins in the 70s, at the moment when Ukrainian visual art began to publicly express its own language, and ends with the war that engulfs the country now.
For centuries, Ukraine has been continuously fighting for its own identity, freedom, language and state borders. The Eastern part joined the then forming Soviet Union after the revolution in 1917-1918 while the Western part joined by military force in 1939.

The Ukrainian Socialist Republic went through a long period of eradicating national identity and formation of new images, new symbols, propaganda and new ‘Soviet’ identity. Old narratives were destroyed, historical facts were manipulated, and those who did not share the new ideology eliminated, literally or by silencing their voices through deportations and other means.

When the Soviet Union fell, Ukraine declared its independence. On August 24, 1991, a new stage of development and restoration of the lost identity began.

‘Ukraine – The Path To Freedom’ looks at the period of the country’s independence, from the first attempts at a revolution in its photographic language in the 70s to the present day. It visualizes key events in the history of Ukraine and looks at the development of photography during this period. The exhibition aims to show how the socio-political and artistic life in the country are intimately connected.

The show consists of four parts, corresponding to four recent historical periods and offers the works of several generations of Ukrainian authors. It shows how photography acts on multiple social levels: as a method of recording changes, as a form of protest, a personal story, a reflection on events and a political statement.

Art is a mirror of society and especially photography can be a means towards deeper cultural understanding and engagement. It tells us how Ukraine is travelling along a historical path of struggle for freedom, for its borders, the right to exist, culture and future. As recent events prove, the price of this struggle is high.

 

During the exhibition, the second edition of ‘The Information Front’ will appear, a more documentary publication series with work by local photographers on the war and the path towards it. 

‘Ukraine – The Path to Freedom’ pioneers an approach from a Ukrainian historical perspective.

Work from the following photographers can be seen during the exhibition: Alexander Chekmenev, Andrii Dostliev & Lia Dostlieva, Andriy Lomakin, Boris Mikhailov, Dmytro Kozatskyi, Elena Subach, Evgeniy Pavlov, Kirill Golovchenko, Lisa Bukreyeva, Maxim Dondyuk, Mila Teshaieva, Mstyslav Chernov, Mykhaylo Palinchak, Mykola Ridnyi, Oksana Parafeniuk, Oleksandr Suprun, Paraska Plytka-Horytsvit, Rita Ostrovska, Roman Khimei & Yarema Malashchuk, Sasha Kurmaz, Valeriy Miloserdov, Viacheslav Poliakov, Viktor & Sergiy Kochetov and Vladyslav Krasnoshchok.

The exhibition is curated by Kateryna Radchenko (Odesa Photo Days Festival) and Wim Melis (Noorderlicht). It is a coproduction between Noorderlicht and Foundation for Old Groningen Churches, in cooperation with Odesa Photo Days Festival and The Information Front.

Tickets to ‘Ukraine – The Path to Freedom’ can be purchased here or at the exhibition desk.

The Groninger Gallery - Portraits from the earthquake area","On 4 February, The Groninger Gallery – Portraits from the earthquake area opens at Museum aan de A in Groningen. The exhibition tells personal stories of residents from the earthquake area in words and images. The portraits and residents’ stories give a unique picture of the area and show a cautious faith in the future. The exhibition was created from a collaboration with BPD Culture Fund, Museum aan de A and Magazine Noorderbreedte.
Groningen deserves our full attention. Noorderlicht and BPD Cultuurfonds are making a cultural connection to the consequences of natural gas extraction and the future of Groningen with an extensive programme: Renewed Energy. This year, the programme begins with The Groninger Gallery – Portraits from the earthquake area.

The Groninger Gallery – Portraits from the earthquake area
Magazine Noorderbreedte interviewed Groningers who are affected by the quakes in various ways. They talk about their future, or, conversely, their inability to formulate it. The interviews show that any substantial future story for Groningen has to start with the painful past, but that it is possible to tell stories that allow us to move forward. Photographer and visual artist Alice Wielinga created staged portraits of the Groningers for the exhibition. The result is a special portrait series that will be on display at Museum aan de A until 11 June.

Museum aan de A, historical museum for the city and province of Groningen, complements this exhibition with information on the history of gas extraction and on the earthquake problems in Groningen. Moreover, at the reading table, visitors can read books, listen to podcasts and share their own ideas about the future of Groningen.

Groningen visible in The Hague
From 24 February, the multimedia exhibition Vergezicht Groningen, panorama op de toekomst can be seen at museum Beeld & Geluid in The Hague. For this exhibition, documentary photographer Dirk-Jan Visser respectfully made video portraits of six Groningers from the earthquake area who share their perspectives on the future. Groningen is more than just earthquakes, Groningen is home to people who are working on interesting, inspiring and innovative initiatives that will make the community and the landscape future-proof.

Report of parliamentary committee of inquiry
The Groninger Gallery – Portraits from the earthquake area and Vergezicht Groningen, panorama op de toekomst will both open in February, the month in which the parliamentary committee of inquiry into natural gas extraction Groningen is expected to present its final report to the House of Representatives, thirty years after the moment when the relationship between gas extraction and the earthquakes was established.

Renewed Energy
Exhibitions The Groninger Gallery – Portraits from the earthquake area and Vergezicht Groningen, panorama op de toekomst are part of Hernieuwde Energie, a multi-year cooperation between BPD Cultuurfonds and Noorderlicht (2021 – 2024).

There will also be activities at Noorderlicht Photo Festival, which this year has the theme REGENERATE and addresses the increasing pressure of huge global challenges in their impact on our coexistence.

“The board of BPD Cultuurfonds hopes in this way, in consultation with Groningen and the Groningers, to make a positive contribution and inspire other parties to invest in this part of the Netherlands. The uniqueness of this area deserves our continued appreciation and attention,” says Mirjam van ’t Veld, chairman of the board BPD Cultuurfonds.",2023.2-2023.8

Groningen is more than just earthquakes, Groningen is home to people working on interesting, inspiring and innovative initiatives to future-proof the landscape and the community.
The problems regarding the natural gas extraction in Groningen have long been a distant memory for The Hague and the rest of the Netherlands. Until the crisis became so apparent that in recent years, it finally claimed the deserved attention of politicians and the media. At the end of February 2023, the parliamentary committee on natural gas extraction Groningen will issue its final report. Much needs to be restored, both physically and in trust and administrative relations. But now is also the time to start looking forward again.

‘Groninger Prospect, a Panorama of the Future’ features six video portraits with photographic images of the Groningen landscape, its people, personal suffering as a result of the earthquakes and impressions of possible future scenarios. In these video portraits, six different people share their experiences and insights into the problems caused by gas production, talk about what Groningen means to them, talk about their experience with damage control, express their disappointment at the lack of trust, make suggestions from personal experience and share their dreams for the future of Groningen.

In the video portraits, the six interviewees address the audience directly. They complement each other, they sometimes contradict each other and it turns out that not everyone agrees with each other. It is clear that ‘THE Groninger’ does not exist. The communities in Groningen are diverse and made up of individuals who all deal with what the earthquakes have brought in an individual way. In any case, it is clear from all the conversations that the earthquakes are not the problem, the problem is how the consequences are dealt with.

With REGENERATE as its theme, the 2023 festival brings together works that explore the changes modern society must face. Where people in today’s world experience a sense of being displaced, regeneration means seeing ourselves and the world as built around reciprocal relationships that benefit all parties. Such a renewed worldview means that people (including their technological achievements) and other living beings within the world’s ecosystems depend on each other for their health, well-being and survival.

Our instinctive relationship with nature encourages us herein. Humans still feel a deep-seated emotional
connection with nature, which we are part of, like all other living beings on this earth. Recognising this is invaluable. Especially in our Western world, where everything strives to be ever more individualistic,materialistic, faster and
efficient, we tend to forget this. Yet in some other cultures, we see this connection with nature coming to the fore.

immediate impact our actions have on the environment, on how ecologically fragile nature is, but equally how strong its self-healing and regenerative capacity is.

The festival, which became a biennial two years ago, offers exhibitions throughout the Northern Netherlands - from Friesland to Groningen and Drenthe - on various dates from now until early December. The festival theme REGENERATE is motivated by the widely- shared feeling that a new, fresh start is needed in our interaction with nature and society. It is about our
relationship with our immediate environment, ourselves and the world we live in. We are therefore approaching the festival from three perspectives: REGENERATE LIFE,REGENERATE OURSELVES and REGENERATE SOCIETY. The works on display at Museum Belvédère focus on the first part: REGENERATE LIFE.
The festival also includes a side programme of projects complementing the festival theme, stemming from various collaborations.

developments. With this idea in mind, the festival wants the exhibited works to ask questions about where we want to go and in what way, about the time we live in and the time yet to come.
Noorderlicht International Photo Festival has been a
biennial for two years and offers exhibitions throughout the Northern Netherlands, on various dates from now until
early December, from Friesland to Groningen and Drenthe. The festival theme REGENERATE is motivated by the widely shared feeling that a new, fresh start is needed in our dealings with nature and society. It is about our
relationship with our immediate environment, ourselves and the world we live in. We therefore look at the festival from three perspectives: REGENERATE LIFE,
REGENERATE OURSELVES and REGENERATE SOCIETY.
The works shown in Museum OpsterlÃn are by photographer Bob Miller, Fatma Celik and Sabine
Grootendorst. They focus on the first part:REGENERATE LIFE.",2023.7-2023.9

Program
The Rolling Stones are back in the exhibition Unzipped at the Groninger Museum! Fancy a bit of rock & roll during Museum Night? Come along and enjoy performances by Collignon and Deejay Irie, among others, get an Airbrush tattoo by ‘Get it on tattoos’ or immortalize yourself in a unique drawing by artists Naomi and Haru. Or, during the night, visit the exhibition PHALLUS. Norm & Form at the University Museum. The male member takes center stage. On a pedestal? Maybe so. But mostly to knock that down from time to time. One thing is sure: the exhibition breaks many clichés.

More into romance than rock and roll? Then take a night cruise on the A and the Zuiderhaven. Between Museum aan de A, where all kinds of workshops are given, and the Groninger Museum, two historic ships sail back and forth with music, poetry, comedy and stories on board! Speaking of the A: a visit to the Akerk should not be missed either. The Druktemaker, the mobile museum print shop of GRID Graphic Museum, will be in the church during Museum Night. All evening you can experiment with printing ink and paper. Roll up your sleeves and make a linocut, silkscreen or risoprint.

In Forum Groningen you get – whether or not dressed as Disney prince(s) – the last chance to admire the major exhibition Disney – Telling Times Stories. Surrounding it are Disney strings, ballroom dancing, a speedy pub quiz and a talk by media scholar Dan Hassler-Forest on how woke Disney is or is not. Storyworld is also open, of course. There, award-winning graphic novel author Aimée de Jong draws the stars from the sky.

In addition to the permanent exhibition and the temporary exhibition, Synagoge Groningen will host performances by the Groningen band Anamesa throughout the evening. With the sounds of traditional instruments, Anamesa will bring Balkan ballads, klezmer and the exhilarating dances of the Mediterranean to life in the colorful synagogue.

In Noorderlicht Studio, Noorderpoort students visualized their own ideas around the Noorderlicht festival theme REGENERATE. REGENERATE explores how we can work together with the planet and its inhabitants for a better future. Expect music, impressive photography and imagine yourself in the future for just a moment.

Joint initiative
The Groninger Museum Night is a joint initiative of the Groninger Museum, Museum aan de A, GRID Graphic Museum in Akerk, Storyworld/Forum Groningen, University Museum, Noorderlicht and the Synagogue. There is also intensive collaboration with USVA, Stichting Oude Groninger Kerken and Noorderpoort.",2023.9
118,Noorderlicht,2023,Sex Shooter - The Liberation of Sexual Identify,"Arts and cultural organizations from 18 cities
European cities are jointly rewriting James Joyces' iconic and high-profile masterpiece Ulysses(1922) titled ULYSSES, European Odyssey. It is a new artistic translation of the book's 18 chapters, each with its own theme. Noorderlicht is the Dutch partner in this ambitious project, focusing on episode XIlI from this classic European masterpiece, in which the theme of sexuality is central. Visual artist Hester Scheurwater was commissioned to elaborate episode XIll in an art installation.

She is doing so together with young artists Nelke Mast and Chiara Pastoor. The title of this multimedia installation is ‘Sex Shooter - The Liberation of Sexual Identity', an explicit and confrontational experience suitable only for visitors over 18. The exhibition runs parallel to Gender Matters:Stories from Istanbul.
The installation 'Sex Shooter, the Liberation of Sexual Identity' is
inspired by Episode XIll of Ulysses by James Joyce and translates the theme of sexuality, voyeurism, and objectification into various gender identities. The installation offers an experience where images,
photographs, videos, sounds, and scents guide the viewer through the exhibition.
Hester: ""By allowing visitors to embark on an inner journey from space to space, I aim to invite them to reflect on changing ideas surrounding identity, sexuality, and non-normative bodies. In my work and the process of creating this installation, I seek to reclaim power over how naked bodies and sexuality are perceived. I want to encourage people to embrace their own sexuality and body image, regardless of their gender identity, and empower them to deconstruct norms and find freedom in self-determination, by promoting gender equality and breaking traditional gender roles."" Short Film
Directed By is a short film consisting of a collection of erotic, surreal and humorous self-portraits. Filmmaker and self-portrait artist Chiara Pastoor takes complete control of her body, sexuality and shameless enjoyment of yourself and your body. By assuming the position of director as well as the woman in the picture, she reclaims power over her body and female nudity on screen. Thus self-portrait art is redefined within the theories of the male, female and internalized male gaze. Recovering from Lyme disease and the sudden death of her brother, Chiara found that the grief surrounding these events had bastardized her relationship with her body. She no longer recognized her own body and felt removed from all need for intimacy and sex. Thus, in 2018, she decided to use the medium of photography to break these blockages. Erotic and nude self-portraits allowed her to revisit sexual needs in a safe playfulness and reconnect with her body. Ulysses
Thanks to a 1.78 million euro grant from Creative Europe for a 33- month cultural project, 18 European cities, led by Brave New World Productions in Leeuwarden, can get to work on a new artistic translation and representation of James Joyce's Ulysses. Noorderlicht, platform for contemporary perception, is the Dutch partner in this ambitious project. Want to know more about this project? Then click here.

119,Noorderlicht,2023,Shifting Baselines,"In the late 1990s,biologist Daniel Pauly introduced the concept of “Shifting Baselines."" It describes a phenomenon in which successive generations form their perceptions of the environment based on their own experiences, unaware of previous states. This gradually changes the understanding of what is
considered “normal"" or “natural."" This ongoing shift in this “baseline"" against which we judge environmental conditions has significant implications for conservation and agriculture.

If each generation accepts a deteriorated or diminished state of the environment as the new norm, it can perpetuate continued
degradation without recognition of the losses that have occurred. This can lead to the ""Shifting Baseline Syndrome"" in which successive generations have lowered expectations of what a healthy ecosystem should really look like. This photography project offers an intriguing glimpse of a future in which the Groningen landscape thrives as a center for regenerative agricultural practices.
These photographs brings a future vision of sustainable crop rotations to life, agroforestry systems, precision agriculture, and soil
regeneration techniques. The images depict the landscape almost as unreal movie sets where the emphasis seems to be on all kinds of
technical developments that seemingly allow one to gain control over various natural processes. The images Eddo Hartmann made for this project provide a critical look at the current belief in far-reaching innovation. Technological developments are often still aimed at maximizing retums. To actually tackle climate change, a different approach is required that includes not only technological advances but also changes in behavior. We must become aware of the impact of our own actions and be willing to adjust our behaviors.
Eddo Hartmann
Eddo Hartmann, born in The Hague in1973, studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. He is a Dutch photographer with a career that has spanned over 25 years. Hartmann is renowned for
capturing striking and thought-provoking images of architecture and urban spaces. Initially, he started his career as a commercial and editorial photographer but later shifted towards long-term
documentary projects. One of his most notable works is“Setting The Stage | North Korea,” which is a series that documents the intricately designed communist capital of Pyongyang.
In addition to his photographic work, Hartmann is also a lecturer in The Hague, where he teaches technical skills and visual grammar.He is committed to capturing the impact of human activity on the planet and its landscapes. Hartmann's work has been widely exhibited and published in newspapers and magazines around the world, and can be found in private and public collections. He has received numerous awards, including the 2018 Lensculture Exposure Award. Currently based in Amsterdam, he continues to work as a freelance photographer.",2023.10-2023.12
120,Noorderlicht,2023,"Akerk
Regenerate Society","At the Akerk, Noorderlicht brings together the work of artists who seek positive change in the world and present alternative perspectives on the reality around us. Whereas the exhibition sometimes takes a foray into REGENERATE OURSELVES and LIFE, here REGENERATE SOCIETY is the focus of the works on display.
REGENERATE SOCIETY refers to the desire to make positive changes and improvements in the way a society functions and to promote quality of life for its citizens.
These processes can take place at various levels, including social, economic, environmental, and cultural. Regenerate is about healing and transforming relationships and systems as well as revising and reconstructing a history whereby the past is transformed into a source of strength and inspiration for the future. Regeneration, in the context of our society, is also about social reform and the pursuit of a better and more just society.
Regenerate showcases stories with renewed insights into both the macro and micro worlds around us. Some of the works on display show that regeneration not only means embracing innovation and advanced technologies but sometimes actually requires reaching back and returning to ancestral traditions and knowledge.",2023.10-2023.12
121,Noorderlicht,2023,International Photo Festival,"In CAMPIS, Noorderlicht shows artists exploring alternative ways of dealing with agricultural life. How do we as humans relate to nature and in what way can we work together to improve our own well-being and that of the planet?
With REGENERATE as its theme, Noorderlicht
International Photo Festival here refers to the desire for a healthy relationship with nature and an active attitude that contributes to strengthening the health and resilience of nature. This can be done in various ways. Sometimes by actively intervening, sometimes by taking a step back and trusting the restorative power of nature itself. The ultimate goal is to keep our world livable.
Our instinctive relationship with nature encourages us to do so. People still feel a deep emotional connection with nature, of which we are a part like all other living beings on this earth. It is invaluable that we realise this. Especially in the Western world, where everything has to be more and more individualistic, material, faster and more efficient, we sometimes forget this. In the global ecosystem, all life is interconnected. With this idea in mind, the festival wants to use the exhibited works to ask questions about where we want to go and in what way, about the time we live in and the time yet to come.
Noorderlicht International Photo Festival 2023 started in Friesland and is now moving across Groningen and
Drenthe. The festival has been a biennial for two years and offers exhibitions throughout the northern Netherlands, on various dates from now until early December.

122,Noorderlicht,2024,DREAMSCAPES,"Be amazed by the dream worlds in DREAMSCAPES. From 18 to 20 January, Kim Hunnersen’s exhibition DREAMSCAPES will be on show during ESNS at Noorderlicht Studio. Kim has a great passion for music and worked for 16 years at Poppodium VERA, where she made posters for the concerts that were printed in VERA’s Artdivision workshop. In her work, she uses photographs as the basis, which she then transforms using collage techniques. The results are imaginative landscapes with a unique signature.
For her collages, Kim uses her own photos of landscapes, travels and anything that inspires her. She combines these with cut-out photographic parts from insect books, books on flora and fauna, the universe and magazines. She then merges the different parts into a new composition with its own story. She does this both on the computer and by hand, cutting and sliding and sometimes using other materials such as ecoline, pastel and paint. Besides music, her sources of inspiration are animals and nature. Fascinated by the colours, shapes and patterns, she takes the viewer into the wonderful new dream worlds that are created. After the design process, the works are screen-printed by hand in small limited editions, built up with different colour layers. The result is a vivid multitude of layers and colours that surprise the viewer. No two prints are exactly the same, making each work unique.

TALENT FROM HERE
Kim Hunnnersen’s exhibition is part of TALENT VAN HIER, a project taking place in cooperation with participating (Visual Arts) partners Kunstpunt, Sign, Het Resort and NP3. With TALENT VAN HIER, presentation spots are created at existing festivals and venues in Groningen. In this way, we use the infrastructure and public familiarity that already exist to offer talents from the region a stage. In this way, we want to work together to make unknown Groningen cultural talent visible and offer it a presentation place.",2024.1
123,Noorderlicht,2023,Pixel Perceptions,"Can you still believe your own eyes? Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms are (un)consciously becoming more and more part of our daily lives. The relationship between man and machine is changing, and in the creative industry, it raises questions about the reliability of images. For example, how does AI impact the creative industry? Noorderlicht is exploring that question this autumn with a powerful group exhibition. Pixel Perceptions focuses on AI and the reliability of images. We look at what impact all those algorithms have on our daily lives and the consequences for creators and the creative industry.
From asking ChatGPT to make a shopping list, to generating images that are indistinguishable from real ones. We challenge you to think about the impact of AI on your life. Are you aware of this influence? What ethical dilemmas does it raise? And could we also use AI in a positive and effective way to raise a more inclusive society? Critical thinking is key, but also thinking in terms of possibilities.

Pixel Perceptions is presented in two parts. The main exhibition starts 19 October in the Akerk in Groningen. In Noorderlicht Studio, young and upcoming talent gives its own interpretation of the theme of Pixel Perceptions. Want to know more about the subject in advance? Then listen to our podcast episode Pixel Perceptions! (Dutch spoken) or read the guest blog from Boris Eldagsen.",2023.10-2024.1
124,Noorderlicht,2024,Noorderlicht x Noorderpoort,"Exhibition AI and Gender Identity by Students Noorderpoort Kunst & Multimedia
In collaboration with Noorderpoort, Noorderlicht will present an exhibition by students from the Kunst & Multimedia department. For six weeks, students will work at the Noorderlicht Studio to explore the theme of AI and gender identity/sexuality. AI offers many opportunities but does not always show how diverse our society is. It is often noticed that results on gender are surprisingly stereotypical. By critically examining these results and the lack of representation in AI systems, the students strive to discover and imagine new perspectives.

They will present their insights, creative process, and challenges in a creative final product that will be exhibited in Noorderlicht Studio.",2024.6
